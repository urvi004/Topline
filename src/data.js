          "In May 2022, Project Baseline Health Study (BHS) participants and researchers from the California Health and Longevity Institute, Stanford Medicine, and Duke University School of Medicine came together to celebrate the Four-Year Anniversary Celebration. Hosted by Principal Investigator (PI) for the Project Baseline Health Study, Shannon Sullivan, MD, and Engagement Committee Lead, Brian Goings-Reid, MPH, the event allowed the community to connect and celebrate the accomplishments of BHS so far. Speakers included Jess Mega, Verily Chief Medical & Science Officer, Co-Founder; and Core Study Lead and PIs Adrian Hernandez, MD, Executive Director of the DCRI; Svati Shah, MD, Duke PI; and Kenneth Mahaffey, MD, Stanford PI. The event included presentations from researchers from our four study sites, interactive polls on participant experiences, and a video of participants sharing their experiences through BHS. \u201cA Celebration of Project Baseline Health Study: Participant Voices and Photos\u201d Our participants emphasized how important it was to feel taken care of by the research site teams and seeing the friendly, familiar faces of those they recognized at each visit. Paired with this sense of belonging was an enduring motivation that their contributions to BHS represented something much bigger than themselves \u2013 that they were part of making a difference in the health of future generations. Participants also revealed another crucial aspect of clinical research: the opportunity to discover new insights about their health, including undiagnosed health conditions. For many, this allowed them to address health concerns that could have otherwise gone untreated. This speaks directly to a belief we have as part of Verily: that empowering people with information about their health allows them to seek proactive, personalized care solutions. Show Me the Data! During the event, many participants expressed a curiosity for the real-world implications of how their contributions are affecting health research and the future of the study. In the world of clinical research, publications of study findings represent more than just a collection of data \u2013 they are proof points from the scientific community that we are moving in the right direction with the work we\u2019re doing, that we have tangible, practical results that could advance our understanding of human health. Accelerated Aging Through the study of blood samples, health assessments, and imaging, researchers aimed to identify abnormalities associated with accelerated aging. The abstract of our research, featured in the American Heart Association\u2019s Circulation journal, found that certain characteristics associated with accelerated aging included being male, heaving heart, blood and kidney abnormalities, and lower vitamin D levels. The results allow future researchers to focus on specific health characteristics and how to prevent the adverse effects of aging. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Depression Practitioners diagnosing mental health conditions like anxiety and depression often utilize standardized tools such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). But they can be inadequate pictures of the lived experiences of these patients.\u00a0This led Project Baseline researchers to focus studies on anxiety and depression by comparing questionnaire scores with various health assessments (biological and physical) as well as demographic and socioeconomic questions. The two depression publications on social determinants and additional health factors found that higher scores for depression were associated with characteristics such as being female, a younger age, Hispanic, and of low socioeconomic status (i.e. employment, income, education, etc.). More research is needed to better understand the relationships between race/ethnicity, age, socioeconomic factors, medical conditions, physical activity, and family dynamics and their associations with anxiety. But the health implications of this research highlight that care providers should consider both their patients\u2019 symptoms and social determinants of health when it comes to the diagnosis and care of anxiety and depression. We\u2019re proud to share that through the efforts of the BHS community, we have 19 total research publications, spanning across general health, mental health, heart health, and COVID-19. And with several ongoing research studies in these areas, we\u2019re even more hopeful for what the future holds. Other than these findings we highlighted, BHS members can find the latest study-related publications in the \u201cDiscover\u201d section of the Baseline App. Looking toward the future of human health Though comprehensive tests will continue until our participants\u2019 4th annual visit, our researchers will conduct long-term follow-up on them to assess the longitudinal impact on health and disease in relation to aging. Participants can continue contributing by responding to surveys and joining more health \u201cmissions\u201d using the Member Portal or app. It is not without the tireless efforts of our researchers and generosity of time and commitment from our participants that BHS has been able to drive forward health research. The event allowed our participants to not only learn from the study findings that they\u2019ve contributed to, but also to share with each other how they feel about being part of this exploration of human health. Shown above is a \u201cword cloud\u201d of live responses from the event, and a hopeful reminder of how participating in clinical research stands as a form of legacy \u2013 to share our experiences now, in order to shape healthier futures for generations to come.",

          "At the end of February 2022, we surveyed 2,700+ members of our COVID-19 Research Community. We wanted to know how confident our community members were in going about their everyday lives, as well as their plans for the near-term future. At the time of this survey, about a quarter (25.2%) of respondents reported not feeling very confident about attending large gatherings, such as concerts, events, weddings, etc. That said, people also reported that they are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident about resuming work (44.3%), school (42.0%), or travel (55.6%), in the next 3 months. As we\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, regular testing will be important moving forward with more people resuming activities in communal spaces. In addition to finding COVID-19 testing sites near you, Verily\u2019s Health at Work program is a helpful solution that can inform workplace safety protocols as companies consider return to office plans. In the next three months, our respondents reported that they plan to continue practicing safe COVID-19 protocols, with the top responses being: Regularly sanitizing/washing my hands Wearing a mask in public places Practicing social distancing Along with their outlook on months ahead, we also asked what influenced respondents\u2019 behavior around COVID-19 protocols and plans in the last three months \u2013 the most common response was the new variant, followed by increases in new community infections and updates from government agencies. Omicron had many of our respondents adapting their behaviors and everyday activities. When asked what ways the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their plans for the start of 2022, respondents were most likely to say that it changed their: Day-to-day activities (e.g. eating out, going to the gym, grocery shopping, etc.) Plans for hosting/participating in events (e.g. weddings, concerts, conferences, etc.) Travel plans We\u2019re thankful to our COVID-19 Research Community for taking the time to provide crucial insights as the pandemic continues to evolve.",

          "As we begin our work in 2022, we want to take a moment to recognize the achievements of 2021 and what the Baseline Health Study (BHS) has accomplished so far.\u00a0 This past year, our community engaged in daily habits that can have a big impact on overall health.\u00a0 We hosted a live webinar for BHS participants to discuss the results of our Sleep Mission, which highlighted the effects of Daylight Savings Time on sleeping patterns \u2013 suggesting that \u201cspringing forward\u201d resulted in changes in our participants\u2019 sleep quality, time, and restedness. With the launch of our Oral Health Study, in partnership with Colgate-Palmolive and the University of North Carolina, we also hosted a live oral health event with experts from Colgate to educate our community on the relationship between oral health and overall health.\u00a0 It\u2019s a testament to the dedication of both our participants and our researchers that we have continued to gather meaningful data that ultimately supports our mission to map human health. These efforts reflect our shared commitment to improve clinical research and accelerate medical breakthroughs.\u00a0\u00a0 So after four years of hard work, you can imagine we\u2019ve collected quite a bit of data. We are excited to share just how much our community has contributed not only in 2021, but also throughout the lifetime of BHS thus far.\u00a0 Of course, these last four years are more than just the hours, the tests, and the surveys. Behind every bit of the data, are the people \u2013 the researchers and the participants themselves who have collectively contributed their experiences to advancing clinical research. And as we continue to grow, we remain thankful to our community of participants who\u2019ve made this all possible \u2013 those who started the journey with us from the very beginning, and those who continued to actively contribute through 2021. We look forward to exploring new insights and future research opportunities in the evolving landscape of health. We set out on this mission to map human health with the hope that our work may inform the future of health research. In 2021, we published Importance of Social Determinants in Screening for Depression. Keep an eye out for many new publications with key insights in the coming year.\u00a0 This is tangible and scientifically significant recognition that the work we\u2019ve been doing is important and impactful.

          "Holidays are important times when families and friends gather to celebrate. As the holidays are fast approaching and COVID-19 is still active in our communities, we must make our loved ones' health and safety our number one priority. The past year has changed our approach to travel and brought about an increased consciousness of health and safety in communal spaces. We wanted to know how our COVID-19 Research Project Community members are navigating the pandemic during the holidays. \u00a0 As noted\u00a0by Dr. Robert Califf, the Verily Head of Clinical Strategy and Policy, it will be important to know quickly whether or not an illness is COVID-19, especially since the holidays also mark the peak of cold and flu season. Luckily, testing is more readily available in the U.S., and Project Baseline is part of this effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19. To find a testing center near you, click here. We put together a few tips adapted from recommendations released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help you stay safe while hosting and gathering with loved ones as you travel for the holidays: For traveling: Getting yourself and eligible loved ones vaccinated can help protect others around you from contracting and spreading COVID-19 Make sure to follow all international and domestic travel restrictions, including wearing a mask on public transportation The CDC still recommends you avoid traveling unless you are fully vaccinated For gathering: Avoid attending/hosting events or gatherings if you are sick or show any symptoms If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 or have had close contact with someone infected with COVID-19, be sure to get tested as soon as possible Try to avoid crowded spaces with poor ventilation and opt for outdoor events when possible Wear masks that properly fit around your nose and mouth in public indoor settings",

          "Heading into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Baseline team at Verily embraced another year of dedicated work to expand the accessibility of clinical research. With the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations across the nation and gradual loosening of previous restrictions, the past year shined a spotlight on how technology, research, and the united efforts of everyday people drove effective solutions in healthcare. The Project Baseline team is proud to share our top five highlights of 2021 and the inspiring contributions of our research participants who made it all possible. 1. A new understanding of mental health After launching the Baseline Mood Study, the valuable insights we gained led to a publication in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Serving as a helpful perspective to inform future remote-based mental health research, the study looked at the connection between smartphone usage and mental health for a 12-week period. In capturing real-world information from participants about their moods, activities, and well-being, smartphones could help provide clinicians with a more complete picture of their everyday lives. The study also represented a shift in mindset \u2013 from subjective insights to the objective, an opportunity to quantify mental health. The results featured new ways to envision and record the daily lived experience of mental health, including the analysis of voice diaries and emoji usage, which showed correlations with symptoms of depression. 2. HLTH 2021 Our very own Dr. Amy Abernethy, President of Clinical Research Platforms and Former Principal Deputy Commissioner of the US FDA, was a headline speaker at the 2021 HLTH Conference in Boston. The conference featured industry leaders discussing how crucial advancements in healthcare and technology are shaping the future of mental health, data platforms, and the overall health of populations. Dr. Abernethy highlighted Baseline\u2019s work to make remote clinical trials a reality and discussed building high-quality, long-term data sets that can open up exciting new avenues of research. 3. Returning research to our communities Baseline strives to increase access to and education about clinical research for all our participants. This mission includes sharing their results and the stories they tell back to our community. How do you sleep? We distributed the results from our 2021 Sleep Mission, where we asked Baseline Health Study participants about the impact that daylight savings time had on their quality of sleep. We also hosted an event with sleep experts to provide a deep dive into understanding the results. Being well-rested has lasting impacts on our overall health, and this study helped demonstrate how important it is to pay attention to resetting our sleep habits. COVID-19 vaccine perceptions Marking one year since the launch of the COVID-19 Research Project, we led a Live Q&A session on the community\u2019s perceptions, experiences, and overall thoughts about the COVID-19 vaccines. With the results indicating that our community had concerns about the vaccines, this session included a Verily data scientist, an immunological expert, and the Verily clinical lead of health informatics as resources for in-depth knowledge and background. The panel helped answer commonly asked questions, including how soon you would be protected after vaccination, the differences between the vaccines, and whether you could still get sick after vaccination. To learn more about COVID-19 variants and vaccinations, read this Q&A with Dr. Charlie Kim, Head of Molecular Sciences at Verily. Understanding priorities for our Gut Research Project participants We launched the Gut Research Project to increase medical knowledge of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which affects an estimated three million American adults. At Baseline, people are at the center of everything we do \u2013 and to help people with IBD, we\u2019re starting by getting their input on the most valuable research areas. We found that the top preferences for our community relate to medications, mental health, alternative medicine, and lifestyle/social factors. Understanding the most pressing issues from our community is important because it helps inform the work we do to ultimately improve participants\u2019 lives. 4. Highlighting women in STEM Women hold 28% of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, and make less than their male counterparts on average. And in order to effect change in our workplace, industry, and society, increasing the visibility of the journeys of women in STEM is essential. To celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we held a YouTube Live Roundtable with several members of Verily leadership including Chief Medical Officer, Jessica Mega, where they discussed their personal journeys and advice for other women interested in STEM. We also reached out to women leaders at Verily to speak about their experiences and what they want others to know about pursuing science careers. Many women shared that STEM careers don\u2019t have to \u201clook\u201d like any single path. Rather, there are many ways to feed one\u2019s curiosity, creativity, and passion through carving your own pathway in STEM. 5. Partnering with Colgate to study oral health Oral health can have a huge impact on overall health. We launched the Oral Health Study for our Baseline Health Study participants in collaboration with Colgate-Palmolive and the University of North Carolina (UNC) to understand this link in more depth. The study focuses on the impact of different oral health practices on participants\u2019 overall health. 2022 Predictions The pandemic brought about a collective, heightened focus on the health of our communities and the need for continued improvements to healthcare and clinical research access. The last two years showed us we have lessons to learn across many different domains. In clinical research, it highlighted just how important it is to have high-quality data. At Baseline, we see an opportunity to support both clinical researchers and their participants by helping them generate real-world evidence from many sources. The work we've done at Baseline so far and will continue to do is centered around how we can ensure the safety and integrity of our participants' data. Their experiences, combined with the vital work of our dedicated researchers, are what drive our efforts to improve the future of clinical research every single day.",

          "Just as many children are heading back to in-person learning, the highly contagious Delta variant is hitting children harder than previous strains. Here's what we know so far about COVID-19 and children. Why are more kids getting sick with Delta? Children are less likely than adults to experience severe COVID-19 illness. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and Children's Hospital Association data, children are between 12- to 15% of all the cases of COVID and 3- to 4% of all the hospitalizations. Because the Delta variant is so infectious, the sheer volume of people getting infected means the number of children hospitalized is going to increase in proportion. Does Delta cause more severe illness in children? We need more data on this. A rare but serious complication of COVID-19 is multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a condition where organs like the heart, kidneys, brain, or others become inflamed. This condition emerges 4-6 weeks after a surge, so if there is an increase, we'll be seeing it soon. What symptoms do kids typically experience with COVID-19? We have some data on this from the COVID Symptom Study, a project through which individuals can log their own or their children's symptoms through a smartphone app. Children most commonly suffered from headaches, fatigue, fever and sore throat, according to an analysis of children who tested positive and had symptoms reported regularly for at least 28 days. How long do children feel sick? Based on data from the COVID Symptom Study, children usually get better quickly (although this data is not specific to the Delta variant). The median length of illness was six days. Younger children recovered more quickly than teenagers. Can children experience long haul COVID-19? Although estimates of how common it is vary, multiple studies have now shown long COVID in children, even though children rarely experience severe initial symptoms of COVID-19. Two studies from the UK showed different rates of children experiencing long haul symptoms. Data from Virus Watch, a research study by University College London and the NHS, showed that 4.6% of children had persistent symptoms lasting more than four weeks. Another UK study of 1,700 schoolchildren showed a similar rate. Around four percent of children had symptoms, such as headache, fatigue and loss of smell, that persisted, with 1.6% showing symptoms for two months or more. One challenge in studying this is that solid diagnostic criteria have not yet been established for long COVID because symptoms can vary so widely. It's important to do so in order to better understand and treat long COVID in children. When will a vaccine be available for children? Clinical trials are currently underway, and US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has said the FDA will \"move fast\" to evaluate data from vaccine companies once it's ready. It's possible a Covid-19 vaccine will be available for kids under the age of 12 before the end of 2021. Is it safe to send kids to school? In-person learning can be achieved with moderated social distancing, proper ventilation, masking, and hand-washing. The CDC has recommended masking in schools to curb the spread of the Delta variant, but decisions on how to enforce these guidelines are down to individual communities. The best source of information for parents on COVID-19 policies in the classroom is their local school district. What should I do if my child gets COVID-19? Call your doctor if your child has a fever, cough, trouble breathing, sore throat, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, dizziness, or just doesn't feel well. Tell your doctor if your child has been exposed or lives in an area with high rates of infection. The doctor can decide whether your child should be tested and what next steps should be. You can treat mild symptoms such as fever and body aches with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) following the correct guidelines for drug dosages. If the doctor thinks your child could have COVID-19, your whole household should stay home until testing is done. Check the CDC's website for details. Keep other members of the family and pets away from the sick child as much as possible. If you can, have your sick child use a separate bathroom. If this isn't possible, wipe down the bathroom frequently using household wipes. Everyone in the family should also frequently wash their hands. Caregivers should wear masks when they're in the same room as a sick child. If your child is over two and can wear a mask without finding it difficult to breathe, they should wear a mask while their caregiver is in the room. Remind your sick child to cover their mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing. If weather allows, open windows to let fresh air circulate. If your child has the following symptoms, go to the ER: looks very sick to you has breathing problems. Their nostrils may puff with each breath, or their muscles may pull in between the ribs. is very sleepy, dizzy, or disoriented has chest pain has cold, sweaty, pale or blotchy skin has very bad stomach pain If your child struggles to breathe, is too out of breath to talk or walk, turns blue, or has fainted, call 911. What can adults do to protect children? The best way adults can protect children is by getting vaccinated. The less virus there is circulating in the population, the less likely it is that children will become infected.

          "Many Americans are looking forward to traveling over the summer months. The CDC has created guidelines for safer travel, and recommends delaying travel until fully vaccinated. Take a look at some of the CDC\u2019s main recommendations to vacation safely this summer. International travel Fully vaccinated travelers (i.e., people two weeks out from their final dose) are less likely to get and spread COVID-19. However, the CDC notes even fully vaccinated travelers might be at increased risk for getting and possibly spreading some COVID-19 variants when traveling internationally. Unvaccinated people who must travel internationally have more travel requirements than fully vaccinated people. Before travel, it\u2019s also important to look up requirements related to travel, mask wearing, testing, or quarantine, in your destination, which may differ from U.S. requirements. Key tips for safer international travel: Learn more on the CDC's international travel page. Domestic travel Masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and while indoors at transportation hubs like airports and stations. Masks are not required in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like a ferry or top deck of a bus). Key tips for safer domestic travel: Learn more on the CDC\u2019s\u00a0domestic travel\u00a0page and use the\u00a0travel planner tool\u00a0to get local information on restrictions in specific areas of the U.S. When not to travel The CDC recommends not traveling if you or your travel companions: Are sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (even if\u00a0fully vaccinated\u00a0against COVID-19 or have recovered from COVID-19 in the past). Have suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 (even without symptoms) Have been around someone with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 in the past 14 days (even without symptoms). Get more information on the\u00a0CDC website for travelers\u00a0and visit the\u00a0Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program website\u00a0to learn if testing is available in your area through Baseline. (Note: always check your destination\u2019s COVID-19 travel rules to confirm when and how to get tested to meet their requirements.)",

          "The Delta variant is becoming a dominant COVID-19 strain worldwide, and is increasing rapidly in the United States. We sat down with immunologist Dr. Charlie Kim, Head of Molecular Sciences at Verily, to learn more about it and the threat it poses to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. What makes the Delta variant so dangerous? The evolution of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is to be expected, but of course it causes new challenges. What we're seeing now is an example: because of the difficulty of getting vaccines into arms quickly globally and expanding access to testing, it's forced an evolution of more severe forms. What's concerning about Delta is that it's more easily transmitted, and it's spreading to different parts of the world quickly. Based on early data, it also causes more severe health outcomes. Vaccines do offer protection, but not all vaccines are as protective against Delta as they are against the original strain of the virus. We need to keep the pressure on vaccination, and in areas with low vaccination rates, testing, masking and distancing. What threat does it pose to vaccinated people? Unvaccinated people? Vaccination is still worthwhile. You should be vaccinated if you want protection against any variant, and vaccination still provides strong protection against severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. Fully vaccinated people are more protected against Delta than those who have only received one shot. What we're seeing is that in communities where there's a lot of infection with Delta, even vaccinated people are more likely to get infected than they were with previous strains. If you're not vaccinated, you're definitely at greater risk than you were a year ago with Delta. If you previously recovered from COVID-19, you likely have some natural immunity, but the recommendation is still to get vaccinated because it offers a different level of protection. Where does this leave people with children under 12 and those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons? Children under 12 are considered unvaccinated individuals, so the CDC's guidance is to follow guidelines for unvaccinated people including masking. The same applies to immunocompromised individuals who are not able to get the vaccine. That said, the more adults who are able to get vaccinated do so, the better. This can bring down the overall infection rates and make things much safer for children and immunocompromised adults. How does relative risk change based on vaccination rates in your area? There is a lot of variation in vaccination across the United States. In San Francisco for instance, around 70% of eligible people are vaccinated. Other areas have much lower vaccination rates. Generally, the higher the rate of vaccination in an area, the safer it is. In areas where vaccination is on the low side and there are still infections, it makes sense to continue to be cautious. That said, we live in a global community and we've seen that as long as the virus is continuing to spread unchecked in one area of the world, it does create risk for all. What would you say about those who are hesitant to get vaccinated due to possible side effects? The vaccines authorized in the U.S. are first-in-class vaccines with a truly remarkable track record in efficacy and safety. We now have data from hundreds of millions of people, and it is remarkable how well the vaccines are working and how safe they are. While there have been some cases of side effects, the numbers are very low, the incidents have been investigated by regulators, and it's been determined that the risk of complications from COVID-19 are much higher than any risk from the vaccines. The vaccines, particularly the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, are working well for now. What is the end game if the virus mutates to become fully vaccine resistant? Let's start with an example for comparison here. The flu virus evolves very quickly, and it's a constant struggle every year to keep up with vaccines. Coronaviruses usually evolve more slowly. Right now, the reason why we're seeing quicker evolution is because it is so widespread. If we can create enough immunity in the global population and reduce the number of infections, that will decrease its ability to evolve quickly, which means fewer severe variants. That is, if we can be aggressive about vaccinations in the U.S. and worldwide. What do you think the future priority research areas are for COVID-19? At the start of the pandemic, around 10-20% of Americans in the hospital were dying, which is a huge number. In late 2020 to early 2021, an evolution in care pushed that down to around five percent. Part of that was new medical treatments, and part of it was changes in care. For example, we found that a process called pronation, or rolling a person on their side to oxygenate their blood, was effective. Going forward, I expect to see more research done in the area of treatments. To learn more about the Baseline COVID-19 Research Project and how you can get involved, visit our website.",

          "Verily Head of Clinical Policy and former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Rob Califf, sat down with us to break down recent CDC guidance for vaccinated individuals. Learn more about the science behind the shift in guidelines. Fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask indoors or outdoors. This has been controversial, with some feeling it's early to make that call. What have we learned about how the virus is transmitted that makes the CDC confident about this recommendation? One of the most difficult things about public policy is that you need to make a strict yes-or-no, binary recommendation. Scientific evidence is not binary, it grows over time and speaks to probabilities and likelihood of risk. We now have many studies that show people who have received vaccines approved in the U.S. are at very low risk of becoming infected. If they do become infected, they are at very low risk of serious illness. Some vaccines approved globally are less effective than the ones available in the U.S. From the original vaccine clinical trials, it was clear that the vaccines were very effective against serious illness or death, and now we know there's a low risk of getting infected at all. If you're\u00a0 vaccinated and in an environment with unvaccinated people or in a big crowd, or riding public transit \u2014 the guidance is still to wear a mask to protect the unvaccinated. I would do that as a courtesy to others. Some states opted to leave mask mandates in place a while longer. What goes into the calculus of a locality or region when deciding its masking guidance? The CDC actually doesn't have authority over states or local public health agencies. We're seeing that different localities have different risk tolerance. In California, for example, health authorities kept the mask mandate in place until mid-June, while many states with lower vaccination rates have decided to remove mask mandates and reopen. One concern is people who don't want to get vaccinated generally don't want to mask. What risk do the unvaccinated pose to the vaccinated? People who received an approved vaccine in the U.S., almost no matter what, have low risk of getting infected. Unvaccinated people with a high viral load pose some risk to the vaccinated, but not much. Currently, we're thinking that being in an enclosed space and the viral load a person has are the biggest factors that go into being a risk to others. Viral load refers to the amount of virus in the upper respiratory tract. The more virus you have in your system, the more of it you expel when you sneeze or speak. The vaccines create an immune response to suppress the virus, so even if you do happen to get it, you have a lower level of viral load. So we're seeing asymptomatic infections or scenarios where you don't get that sick. Where does this leave parents of unvaccinated children or the immunocompromised? Are they at greater risk if adults stop wearing masks? Children age 12 and older can now get vaccinated, so we strongly recommend parents of older children help them get vaccinated. For kids under age 12, it's a dilemma. The recommendation for younger children is to continue to wear masks and social distance, but this can be a challenge with summer activities. I expect we'll learn more over the summer about how to best manage risk for younger children, with more safety data. Similarly, for the immunocompromised, the recommendation is to continue to mask and stay distanced. The best thing people can do to protect the immunocompromised is to get vaccinated. As you mentioned previously, there is still some risk of \"breakthrough\" COVID infection when vaccinated. Doesn't this run counter to the idea of removing masks before herd immunity? Herd immunity is a concept \u2013 we don't know exactly what level of vaccination is needed to achieve it and completely eliminate the virus. Most experts don't think we can fully eliminate this virus and that it will be endemic, or present in the population at some basic level, similar to the flu and other viruses. Vaccines approved in the U.S. do work against the variants that are emerging. That said, they are less effective, which is why it's important to vaccinate as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, to get the virus to a manageable level. What's the risk of someone who gets COVID-19 when vaccinated sustaining \"long COVID\"? So far, it looks like the risk of long COVID in vaccinated individuals is very, very low based on the data we have from thousands to millions of people. It is still possible, and in the few people where that happens, it may be due to immune system differences that we're still learning about. For people who get COVID-19, develop long COVID, and then get vaccinated, we're seeing some evidence that getting the vaccine can help. We're not sure why that is yet, but one theory is that individuals with long COVID may continue to harbor the virus in the body after the initial infection, and the vaccine helps fight it. Do we know any more about how long immunity lasts? Is it possible that we'll need booster shots in a number of months? We are collecting data that shows a strong immune system response that goes out pretty far from the original vaccination, but we're only a year or so into this pandemic and can't be sure of exactly how long immunity lasts yet. However, mRNA vaccine platforms lend well to making boosters, so we are set up to produce them. Personally, when would you feel comfortable not wearing a mask in a crowded indoor function? I'll continue to wear a mask until we see the follow-up from summer holiday weekends, where people will likely wear fewer masks but many more will be vaccinated. In the fall, we should consider masking as it's a good way to prevent the flu and other seasonal viruses. Our immune systems will be tested more during fall and winter by spending increased time indoors and coughing from other viruses. We've seen in Asia that masking has helped stop pandemics earlier, so I am hopeful that we may adapt to wearing masks during higher-risk time periods and situations",

          "Forty percent of adults in the United States struggled with a mental health disorder during COVID-19, according to the CDC. Along with this increase in need, utilization of mental healthcare like digital apps and telehealth for accessing talk therapy has risen tremendously. We sat down with Verily Mental Health Lead, Dr. Danielle Schlosser to understand how people are coping in the current phase of the pandemic, and tips for managing stress. How has COVID-19 impacted mental health in the U.S.? It's important to note that the mental health impact of the pandemic has not been one-size-fits-all. On the one hand, we've seen huge increases in mental health needs as well as really high adoption of mental health services. Many people nationwide are dealing with grief from losing loved ones during the pandemic. There's also evidence to suggest that many people who recover from COVID-19 have long-term struggles with mental health, with one study showing that one in five COVID survivors has a mental health disorder. We're also seeing a lot more openness around talking candidly about mental health struggles. Interestingly, on the flip side, we're also seeing some people experience \"post-traumatic growth.\" Some are reporting positive experiences around feeling more connected to family and friends, or benefiting from reduced time spent commuting among those who are able to work from home. The mental health impact of the pandemic is nuanced, and we'll continue to see this as we hopefully shift into a new normal. Currently in the U.S., the approach to managing the pandemic and public health guidance is changing. As vaccinations increase and many communities loosen restrictions, what can happen with people's mental health? In the U.S., there is a sense of seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and many people are feeling excited about a return to normal in sight. By the same token, however, many people have also adapted to the pandemic over the course of the past year and we've settled into certain habits and routines. Some feel anxiety around socializing, even if they crave it. Humans are predisposed to feel stress around major life changes, and our brains like predictability. For example, getting married, having children, and graduating high school are all seen as positive events, but it takes time to adjust to the new normal. The best way to manage this stress is to be gentle with yourself and validate your experience, realizing it's one shared by many. One technique from talk therapy is identifying and naming an experience. When you're in the midst of swirling thoughts that seem very chaotic, you may not recognize it as anxiety. In psychology, we refer to these thought patterns as \"rumination.\" Naming these experiences isn't meant to stigmatize, but actually to gain a sense of control. It can also be helpful to internalize that thought patterns are just thought patterns, not who you are. One technique of managing a detrimental thought pattern is to catch it, check it, and change it. This process involves being mindful and aware of when you start slipping into rumination, so you can challenge the unhelpful thought and replace it with an alternative thought. On the preventative side, evidence shows us that physical activity, meditation and being in nature can help reduce stress. Socializing can also help, which can seem counterintuitive if you're experiencing anxiety around socializing. But this can involve connecting with a partner or family member and just getting out of your own head. How can people cope with information overload? Greater exposure to news can induce stress, and digital hygiene can help. If you notice your heart rate goes up when you watch the news, for instance, notice and identify that. You can stop automatic notifications on your phone from news apps in order to create more control over when and how you consume information. How can people navigate sensitive conversations around masking and vaccination with family and friends? This is really hard, especially given how divisive the dialogue around public health has become in the U.S. When you're having a difficult conversation about a really important public health guideline like vaccines, getting curious about the other person's feelings and what is at the heart of their perspective is a good place to start. When a decision gets into people's value system and identity, it will not be productive and constructive to quickly criticize their point of view. One way to navigate these conversations is by sharing information so they can have the best data available to them to consider their choice. We can orient these conversations around helping people feel empowered to make these decisions, rather than controlled.",

          "One in five U.S. adults experiences mental illness. In honor of Mental Health Month, we sat down with data scientist Stefanie Nickels to learn about how digital tools can unlock better ways of managing mental health. Why is it important to focus on mental health research, especially now with the impact of COVID-19? Over the past 30 years, we've seen no improvement in mental health outcomes. Mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States, and anxiety and depression have only increased during the pandemic. Social isolation and worries around getting sick or losing loved ones can exacerbate existing mental health conditions. Not only is there a cost to the healthcare system, mental health issues have a profound impact on the sense of self, emotional and physical well-being, and the professional and personal relationships of the individual. What are digital therapeutics and why are they interesting in the mental health space? Digital therapeutics are technology tools used to prevent, treat, or manage a disease. We can deliver many types of therapies digitally. Telehealth allows you to speak to a mental healthcare provider via video chat, removing the barriers of needing to be in the same room if you';re physically distant or experience mobility challenges. There are also apps with built-in cognitive behavioral approaches \u2013 a common type of psychological treatment \u2013 that can teach valuable skills in a scalable way that's accessible to many people. You can go at your own pace, using an app that's always available and private. What is a digital biomarker and what's an example in mental health? A digital biomarker is something you can measure digitally that indicates mental health status. A simple one is how long you sleep. Sleep disturbances are associated with depression so changes in sleep can indicate a shift in mental health. Smartphones contain sensors that can capture data relevant to health, and figuring out how to translate this information into useful insights is still a young field. One of the data points mental health researchers are interested in is location, because it helps us infer how much time people spent at home. Increased homestay is associated with depression, as is increased social media app usage and decreased physical activity, which are other things we can infer from smartphone use. Can you describe some notable aspects of mental health research that Baseline has conducted? Most clinical studies are conducted at a study site like a hospital. For the Baseline Mood Study I and II, we set out to make them completely remote, easy to access, and fun. The studies were self-guided using an app, and one of the notable aspects was the use of an engaging chatbot that led participants through daily activities. We also used a mix of clinically validated electronic questionnaires that are approved by a body of experts to accurately measure something related to health, and more novel research approaches like audio diaries. What is next with mental health research and care, and what do you hope we can achieve? On the research side, we have a lot of work to do in finding digital biomarkers and provide evidence that they are valid mental health measurements that can tell healthcare providers something meaningful about mental health outside the clinic. This in turn can enable better care. Measurement-based care is routine in other fields, but not in mental health. For example, with diabetes we continuously monitor A1C levels to understand if the disease is being controlled. What this might look like for psychology and psychiatry could be completing a questionnaire every one to two weeks in order to quickly identify whether a treatment is working. One reason this isn't being done today is that it's burdensome to providers, but through an app, this type of data can be collected very quickly.",

          "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to the importance of clinical research, as well as health disparities in the United States. Black and Latinx communities are experiencing disproportionate rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, and racial and ethnic minorities have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. Diversity in clinical trials is important because medications and other health interventions can affect people differently based on a number of factors including age, genetics and sex. However, just 14% of clinical research participants are from minority racial or ethnic groups. The reasons for this underrepresentation are multifaceted, but we know that accessibility of research opportunities is a significant factor. Joining clinical research studies has traditionally been a complex endeavor and significant commitment, involving spending weeks to months participating on-site academic medical centers. This effectively excludes anyone outside of major metropolitan areas, for instance. Barriers like lack of access to care and institutional bias can also play a role in the underrepresentation of individuals from minority groups. For instance, some research suggests that physicians are not as likely to discuss clinical trials with patients of color. Our team of scientists, technologists, and patient advocates created Project Baseline with a goal of shifting these trends. By making research easier to navigate and access from anywhere, we hope to engage as broad a population as possible in studies that can ultimately benefit health for all. In light of the pandemic, we've seen in real-time the growing importance of being able to participate in research from home, in a way that fits into participants' lives \u2013 not vice versa. Two of our newest research opportunities \u2013 designed for fully at-home participation \u2013 actually happened to coincide with the pandemic. The Baseline Skin Study and the Mirai Depression Study both involve using smartphones to capture health information remotely that can then be used by researchers to better understand health. These studies also involve a mix of in-home and virtual visits with health practitioners to oversee participant progress, while adhering to strict COVID-19 protocols. These studies build on a foundation established by the Baseline Health Study, a longitudinal study that observes thousands of participants and how their health evolves over four years. The Baseline Health Study was designed from the beginning to incorporate data collection in the real world, from a diverse population. The Health Study is representative of the racial and age distribution of the U.S., which allows us to draw scientific conclusions that are relevant to multiple groups. Due to historical inequities in how research studies were designed and conducted, as researchers, we believe it's important to partner with community members to ensure studies and technologies are inclusive. As part of the Health Study, our study teams engage closely with advisory boards made up of participants and community members who provide input on the study's direction. Similarly, our collaboration with the American Heart Association, Research Goes Red, recently awarded a research grant to Dr. Bertha Hidalgo who is conducting a study on how to engage millennial women of color in heart research through online communities. More broadly, the research community as a whole is focused on taking steps to increase diversity. In the context of COVID-19, the FDA has provided guidance to biopharmaceutical companies encouraging \"enrollment of populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities.\" Communities of color are also mobilizing resources to promote vaccine acceptance and education, including the Black Coalition Against COVID-19, an alliance of historically Black universities. By continuing to make research more accessible, and working to address and overcome historical inequities and barriers, we hope to change the statistics and create a world where we can all live longer, healthier lives.

"Curiosity was my biggest inspiration, but key mentors I met throughout my journey are the biggest reason I got involved in STEM as a career." - Angela DiCiccio, Product Engineer "Curiosity to solve the unsolved." - Dr. Meghna Beotra, Finance\u00a0 BI Analyst "I love learning how things work! Biology gives me a deeper appreciation of my own precarious existence and leaves me in continuous awe of the complexity and balance of the natural world." - Zoey Ferguson, Research Associate "I had so many small nudges in that direction - a math award in second grade, a visit to my grandparents in sixth grade during which my grandfather pulled out a binary logic workbook to entertain me, a dad who was hopeless with anything mechanical and left me to install new light fixtures, replace car radios, and repair broken door knobs. I also had fabulous math teachers in middle and high school. Most importantly was probably all the history books my parents bought for me and the weeks I spent at law camp. I was definitely not going to follow in my parents\' footsteps and become an attorney." - Caitlin Donhowe, Software Engineer, Surgical Analytics "My mom and my dad, who are both graduates in mathematics and successful in banking. I was very lucky to have been born in an educational culture where I could not perceive any difference between genders or being pushed to gender-based careers until I reached undergrad engineering school. My parents treated my elder brother and I the exact same way in inspiring us both to study and take on STEM careers." - Nivi Arumugam, Head of Sensors Engineering "I followed my insatiable curiosity down a STEM path so I could discover how things work and have fun coming up with clever solutions to complicated problems." - Nursen Ogutveren-Armea, Software Engineer "In high school I wanted to either become a doctor or journalist because I wanted to understand health and share that information with the masses. I found public health in undergrad while volunteering as a sex educator in Chicago Public Schools while witnessing stark health disparities; I knew I wanted to do something about it. I worked in a variety of research roles both in academia and evaluating community health programs with the goal of improving public health." - Jaclyn Shea, MPH User Experience Researcher What do you want women and girls to know about STEM careers? "It\'s okay to not have a plan and follow your passion - that\'s how you\'ll change the world the most. Highest of all though, don\'t doubt your passion, continually work on communication, and have fun!" - Angela DiCiccio, Product Engineer "There is no such thing as\u00a0 a silly question. Ask to quench your thirst for knowledge." - Dr. Meghna Beotra, Finance BI Analyst "It turns out that you don\'t have to choose between practicing science and creativity! Many of the best scientific ideas and insights come from people who practice creativity in their personal and professional life." - Zoey Ferguson, Research Associate They are so varied - I started in mechanical engineering because it seemed the most approachable for someone who didn\'t have access to coding or robotics or AP physics classes in high school, and to be honest, it wasn\'t a great fit. It\'s been a gradual migration ever since, figuring out which bits of each class/job I like best and trying to get more of those bits in my next class/job. Nearly two decades later I\'m deep in algorithms and big data and there is no technical drawing in my life. I\'m much happier for it!" - Caitlin Donhowe - Software Engineer, Surgical Analytics "STEM careers are very gratifying and shape the present and future of the world. Every day at work is fun, provides ample opportunities for encountering new experiences and enjoying the best of life. There is never a dull moment." - Nivi Arumugam, Head of Sensors Engineering "STEM isn\'t for one particular \'type\' of girl. STEM is for everyone, so don\'t rule it out too quickly! Whether you think you\'re \'good at math\' or you think you\'re \'more of an artsy type\' there\'s a fulfilling career for you in a STEM field, because there are as many different ways to be creative and solve problems as there are problems to solve!" - Nursen Ogutveren-Armea, Software Engineer "STEM is diverse! I\'ve conducted qualitative and quantitative research in public health and tech. There is no single path, but rather many ways to one\'s passion related to STEM to making the world a better place. I went from conducting research on taboo topics (sex, HIV, transgender healthcare) to researching how to design and improve healthcare products like patient apps and medical devices." - Jaclyn Shea, MPH User Experience Researcher Why is it important for women to be represented in STEM? "STEM fields are magical forums for learning, collaboration, and exploration but will only thrive with diversity!" - Angela DiCiccio, Product Engineer "Every mind counts when the world is working to answer questions. Women can contribute immensely by bringing in their perspective and contributing to a pool of ideas." - Dr. Meghna Beotra, Finance\u00a0 BI Analyst "Having badass STEM women around me reminds me that women can do incredible things because of their gender, not despite it. Any level of added diversity richens the wealth of perspectives, and the historical lack of a female presence in STEM makes it all the more meaningful." - Zoey Ferguson, Research Associate "Because they have so much to add! We can develop better products if we have diverse teams to develop them. And the flip side of that, because there are women who are happiest in STEM jobs! My grandmother bemoaned the fact that my husband doesn\'t earn enough for me to stay home with our kids. I would be desperately unhappy at home with our kids!" - Caitlin Donhowe - Software Engineer, Surgical Analytics "Women make up more than half of the world and the world is shaped by STEM industries. It is imperative for women\'s decisions, actions and perspectives to equally change how the world is and will be. The world will be a better place with equal representation of all of its inhabitants in areas of influence and power." - Nivi Arumugam, Head of Sensors Engineering "People who work in STEM define the choices for everyone. What products are available at Target? What medicine is available at the pharmacy? What apps are available on your phone? People in STEM create these options. Women need to be in STEM roles to make sure there are options that work for us, and so\u00a0that there are solutions to problems women are uniquely positioned to see and understand." - Nursen Ogutveren-Armea, Software Engineer "We all see the world through our own experiences. When only men are in STEM they research and design with themselves in mind as the default. The incredible book Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed For Men thoroughly details how our world is biased against women because men have traditionally created products and services. The more diverse perspectives we have in STEM, the more research and products will be inclusive to women and other oppressed communities." - Jaclyn Shea, MPH User Experience Researcher',

          "Vaccines are a powerful tool for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. In order for the vaccines to be effective, public trust and effective distribution are critical. Experts estimate that about 70% of the U.S. population will need to receive the vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity and start to return to normal life. The U.S. vaccination program faces a number of challenges, and much more work remains to be done on tackling both the efficiency of distribution and vaccine hesitancy. By studying both aspects of the vaccine campaigns, Project Baseline\u2019s research goal is to gain insights that can help support a smooth rollout. The Baseline COVID-19 Research Project is launching new online research activities\u00a0 focused on: Vaccine sentiments: participants' thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of vaccination Vaccine usage: date, dosage, and other key information about vaccination, for those able to receive a vaccine Given widespread disinformation, understanding the perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines is a particularly urgent priority. Within our own research community, understanding members' feelings and open questions can provide guidance where we can help by providing relevant scientific information. We're surveying the more than 150,000 members of the community to learn sentiments across different demographic groups, including any concerns and how informed they feel to make the decision to receive the vaccine. We're also tracking vaccine uptake and usage within the community. There are currently three vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson, respectively, approved to use in the U.S., and that number may increase. After vaccines are available, a standard part of the clinical research process involves continuing to monitor how people do over the long term. Our research is intended to help generate data about the rollout itself by tracking which vaccines people receive, demographics of vaccine recipients, any side effects like arm pain, and adherence to returning for the second dose. We look forward to sharing the results with the community. To learn more about or sign up for the COVID-19 Research Project, visit our website.",

          '2020 was a year like no other. In the face of the greatest public health challenge in a century, the Baseline team was honored to play a part in supporting public health experts, researchers, and communities in their efforts to address the pandemic. While the year was difficult for many, we remained inspired by the research participants who make Baseline possible. Here are our predictions for what\u2019s on the horizon for 2021, and top five moments of 2020. "In 2021, many countries will begin vaccination programs that will hopefully provide a powerful tool in combating the pandemic. At Baseline, we will continue to support research and trials to better understand COVID-19 and support treatments and vaccines." - Casimir Starsiak, Lead, Project Baseline "Organizations that do clinical research have a common vision for the future: a more patient-centric world where research is accessible to everyone. To make that vision a reality, we need systems that talk to one another, enable real-world data capture, and help us understand that data in new ways. One of our 2021 goals at Baseline is to continue building a unified platform that helps researchers deliver the experience patients need, while conducting high-quality science." - Jelena Pjesivac-Grbovic, Head of Engineering, Project Baseline "COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of telehealth and virtual care. We anticipate that telemedicine will remain a significant part of medical practice into 2021 and beyond. We also believe that in the coming years, we\'ll see a similar movement in clinical research. Project Baseline was created to bring the benefits of greater accessibility and technologically-enabled participation to research and care. We look forward to continuing to build on that momentum and making research participation easier and more rewarding." - Jessica Mega, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, Verily Baseline\u2019s Top 5 2020 Highlights 5. Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program Launch- In the early days of this pandemic, it was clear that COVID-19 was overwhelming countries. As a group of scientists, clinicians, and engineers, we began to contemplate what we could do to support a critical public health crisis. In conversation with federal, state, and county agencies, we heard about the primary roadblocks to respond, including scalable risk screening and testing capacity. We were asked by the agencies to contribute however we could, and moved with great urgency to develop The Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program. This required a foundational system that enables secure collection and storage of health information, and we used the existing Project Baseline platform, which is purpose-built for this use. More than 1.7 million individuals have received testing through the Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program, which streamlines the process from screening to testing to return of results. 4. Baseline COVID-19 Research Project - We launched the Baseline COVID-19 Research Project in order to advance the scientific understanding of COVID-19. Participants who choose to join have access to relevant clinical studies and research activities, which may include scientific research and testing of new tools, treatments or interventions. One of our first initiatives, Baseline Antibody Research, focused on the human immune response to infection. To learn more about the results from this research, check out this video. 3. Building resilience together - A core part of our mission is making research easily accessible to people, and providing them with useful information that can help them live healthier lives. Members of our research communities complete regular online research activities on health topics that can range from habits to feelings and emotions. During the pandemic, the Baseline community reported increased emotional strain. We called upon our mental health experts, Danielle Schlosser, PhD, Senior Clinical Scientist and Alanna Robinson, LICSW, Mental Health Coach, to lead a virtual event for Baseline members focused on building resilience and coping with adversity. If you missed the event, you can watch the video here. 2. First research grants - Research Goes Red, a collaboration between the American Heart Association\'s Go Red for Women and Project Baseline, has awarded two grants to researchers to engage women as partners in research. The studies are focused on: Exploring women\'s health at the intersection of menopause, weight and health habits. Understanding connections between social media use, health information and heart disease in millennial women. We look forward to sharing more about the studies, including eligibility criteria, in 2021. 1. Launching new research opportunities - While we have a comprehensive map of the world, we don\'t yet have an equally detailed understanding of all areas of human health.\u00a0 This year, we aimed to fill in more of the human health map. To learn more about open opportunities, you can visit projectbaseline.com. To our participants, now more than ever, we thank you for your contributions to helping us all lead healthier lives. We look forward to discovering even more together in the years to come.',

          "Being a parent in 2020 has been exhausting. Between closed schools, cancelled events and lapses in childcare, parents also spend their mornings and nights worrying about how they can keep their child safe from the COVID-19 pandemic that is sweeping the globe. While testing has grown to be widely available for many, this crucial pediatric population is being missed and recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among youth is increasing. Today, we're making COVID-19 testing available to teens ages 13-17, across the Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program, which currently operates at over 300 testing sites across 15 states. Teens aged 13 and up, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, will now be able to register for testing under the supervision of a legal guardian and securely receive their testing results. To register, individuals aged 13-17 will need to create their own Baseline COVID-19 testing account under the supervision of their parent or legal guardian. Registrants will be prompted to share authorization from their parent or legal guardian prior to completing the online screening survey to determine their eligibility for receiving a test. Once the screening survey is complete, individuals will be able to schedule an appointment at a nearby testing location. Minors must be accompanied to the appointment by a parent or legal guardian who will be required to show a photo ID to confirm their identity. Test results will typically be shared with the individual within 2-5 days of the appointment. Those with a positive result will receive a phone call to the number associated with their account, otherwise all negative results will be sent to the individual through their Baseline online portal. At Verily, we have focused on the security and privacy of personal health information since the inception of our Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program, which operates under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and employs the appropriate security controls that map to the HIPAA Security Rule. Information collected by the program is mandated by the state and federal reporting requirements for COVID-19 testing and will ultimately be deleted through the Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program, unless an individual separately authorizes further retention and use of information. We are proud of the work we have done with our partners to increase access to testing in the U.S. Expanded testing access to individuals ages 13 and up is an important next step in the fight against COVID-19. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Why expand testing to teens now? A: Due to limited testing supplies, testing initially focused on adults with underlying conditions as data showed they were at higher risks of developing complications from COVID-19. Youth infected with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults, but youth are still at risk of developing severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among youth is increasing. Q: How do you protect the privacy of teens? A: Verily has focused on the protection of the security and privacy of personal health information since the inception of its Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program. Verily's Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program operates under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and employs the appropriate security controls that map to the HIPAA Security Rule. We will retain an individual's information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program or until applicable emergency declarations related to COVID-19 expire or are otherwise terminated, whichever is later. Thereafter, we will delete information collected through the Baseline COVD-19 Testing Program, unless an individual separately authorizes further retention and use of information. To learn more, read our privacy policy. Q: Will teens receive any communications from Verily? A: Minors will receive communications related to the scheduling and administration of their test. Verily will not send communications unrelated to the COVID-19 testing program to minors. Q: Will adults need to accompany teens to be tested? A: Yes. This program is intended to support pediatric testing under the consent and supervision of a legal adult guardian. Teens (ages 13-17) must have an adult legal guardian accompany them to the appointment, and supervise them and assist them as needed during the testing procedure. Parent or legal guardians are required to show photo ID at the testing site. Q: Do teens require their own Google Account in order to be tested? A: Yes. We are directing parents and legal guardians to help establish these accounts for their teens to support COVID-19 testing. The parent or legal guardian of the teen being tested will need to electronically sign a consent form. Q: Where will the test results be delivered? A: Individuals with a positive result will receive a phone call to the number associated with their account. All negative results will be sent to the participant through the Baseline online portal and to the email address used to establish the testing account.",

          "Health isn't all about the numbers in your chart when you visit the doctor. One of the ways researchers can get a holistic view of health, across different populations, is by designing scientifically valid surveys that can help answer research questions. We sat down with biostatistician Sarah Short to learn more. Why is it important and valuable to get self-reported data from participants for research? Historically, researchers focused more on clinical, objective data because there was less trust in the quality and usefulness of subjective, self-reported information. As research has matured, we've taken a more patient-centered focus, which means taking people's perceptions and experiences into account when evaluating the effectiveness of treatments. There are important aspects of patient experience that cannot be captured through clinical measurements like temperature, blood pressure, or lab results. For example, when we're studying a new treatment, we can measure how effective it is clinically, but that doesn't tell us about patient satisfaction with the treatment. If we discount that, we run the risk of creating something that doesn't fit into people's lifestyles. Also, with remote research increasing, it's much easier to collect such data than it was when everything had to be collected at a physical study site. What were some of the challenges associated with surveying people before? Having a human interviewer or doctor in the room (or even on the phone), asking the questions, can introduce bias. Electronic surveys can lead to more honest results. They can also help us collect information about people who may not be as easy to include in typical trials, including people who face challenges with mobility issues or access to care. One way we're trying to use more inclusive, digital means of conducting research to reach underrepresented groups is through Research Goes Red, our collaboration with the American Heart Association. Heart disease is thought to be more of a problem for men, and women may not be aware of their risks. That's an important gap to fill. We're focusing on learning about the community's motivations and health concerns so researchers can get more insight on how to help. One challenge we've always had, even with more remote research opportunities, is the digital divide. Many groups don't have reliable access to the internet. While research is growing more inclusive, there's still a lot of work to be done to engage traditionally underserved groups. What's the process for creating a scientific survey? How do you ensure the results are valid enough to draw conclusions for research? It's definitely not as simple as putting a few interesting questions together and sending out a poll! Some of the surveys we use are validated instruments \u2013 surveys that have been developed to serve a specific purpose and which have been rigorously evaluated for reliability and validity. However, to answer more specialized research questions, we often create our own surveys. This involves bringing together clinicians, researchers, survey design experts, statisticians, and user experience teams to collaborate on clear, unbiased questions that will lead to the right kind of data to answer your research question. This can be inherently challenging when you're conducting experimental research and trying to uncover new markers of health and disease. It's also important to get surveys right the first time. Changing survey questions makes it more difficult to analyze them over time. Some surveys might measure more clinical information \u2013 for example, changes in symptoms \u2013 while others can be more qualitative. Both types of data are valuable to researchers. Can you give an example of scientifically interesting insights or research we've gleaned from scientific surveys? As part of the Baseline COVID-19 Research Project, survey data collection serves multiple purposes. With the intense pace of research to find vaccines and treatments \u2013 and save lives \u2013 it's important to find the right people to join studies. We're able to reach a broad sample of people and learn about their symptoms, which can help with pre-screening for research opportunities. The COVID-19 Research Project can give us a lot of interesting longitudinal, or long-term, population health data. For example, our surveys around social distancing and behaviors reveal that mask use is increasing in our cohort over time. This can help us understand how public health information is understood on an aggregate level. We can also see patterns over time around people's emotional experiences and coping mechanisms. We found an association between hours of exercise and improvements in mood. This isn't necessarily a surprising finding, but it shows that even in this time, there are activities that can help reduce stress. Access to data can help us pinpoint strategies for addressing the virus' impact and provide help where people need it. Based on the findings from our wellbeing surveys, we recently hosted a webinar specifically focused on coping strategies for the pandemic drawing from research data. Why is it important to return data from research? It can be tricky to return results when we're asking people subjective questions about their feelings and experiences, particularly when asked repeatedly over time. We have to consider whether sharing results will influence further responses down the road. This is one reason why results usually are not shared until the end of a study. However, it's important for us to prioritize navigating those challenges to identify data we can share without introducing bias. We value our participants, not just the data they provide. This is one way we show participants that they are valued, and that their contributions have a meaningful impact.

          "This year, National Minority Health Month -- an effort to raise awareness of health disparities across different populations -- falls squarely within a pandemic that, according to new data from a number of cities, counties, and states, disproportionately impacts minority racial and ethnic groups. At Verily, we are working with public and private entities to expand access to COVID-19 testing for everyone. This month, we are launching multiple new community-based testing sites with the state of California, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) -- a nonprofit relief organization founded by Sean Penn that is dedicated to saving lives and strengthening communities affected by or vulnerable to crisis -- to extend testing to rural and under-resourced communities. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minority populations In New York City, preliminary data shows that the novel coronavirus is killing black and Latino people at twice the rate of white people, though each comprises less than half the population.\u00a0Eighty one percent of COVID-19 deaths and nearly half of all cases in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin are occurring in the black community, just 26% of the population. Similarly, in Louisiana, black people account for 70% of COVID-19 fatalities while representing 33% of the population.These early data indicate a troubling pattern emerging around COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. It is important to note that we don't yet have a full picture of COVID-19's impact on communities of color. In many cases nation-wide, the data are preliminary, and racial and ethnic data aren\u2019t available for all confirmed cases. Because public health departments may collect and report data differently, not all are tracking hospitalizations and mortality by race. Additionally, across the United States, efforts are underway to scale testing more broadly to provide more equitable individual care and to improve visibility into public health. However, the current evidence of disparities is unsurprising to most health experts based on well-known historical disparities in disease burden and health outcomes across the U.S. Why are we seeing more severe disease among people of color? The common chronic diseases that confer increased risk of severe outcomes for those infected with COVID-19 are much more common in people of color. These common chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and kidney disease, lead to much higher rates of intensive care unit admission, need for ventilator support and death in people who are infected with the novel coronavirus. The disease burden in minority communities is also related to less wealth and lower education levels, factors that make social distancing more difficult.Individuals from minority groups also comprise a large portion of the services industry and frontline workers -- potentially contributing to increased negative health outcomes. While people of color make up a quarter of the U.S. workforce, they represent a high proportion of \"essential workers.\" The majority of nursing assistants in care homes -- where numerous outbreaks have occurred -- are people of color, and more than a third are black. In New York City, now considered the epicenter of COVID-19 in America, 75% of all frontline workers, including people working in healthcare, transit, trucking, and grocery, are from minority backgrounds. With greater risk of exposure to the virus, first responders are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Likewise, the shuttering of the services industry may lead to widespread loss of insurance within communities of color, along with disproportionate economic impacts, which are associated with poor health outcomes. Due to decreased job security and lack of access to care, these communities may now be even more vulnerable.When it comes to health, location plays an important role. Even within the same city, a\u00a0study by the National Institutes of Health found that life expectancy can vary widely from one neighborhood to the next. Black Americans are\u00a0almost twice as likely to live in areas expected to be most affected by COVID-19. Taking steps toward mitigation In this acute stage of the pandemic, we're still at the beginning of the journey to fully understand and contend with COVID-19's effects on our communities. As health officials respond to its complex and wide-ranging impacts, we're starting to see interventions take shape that can benefit high-risk populations. Examples include:1. Expanding testing - Testing is critical to containing and understanding COVID-19, and will be key to reducing the risk and severity of future outbreaks. The California community-based testing program is open to Californians regardless of insurance status, is free of charge, and occurs under physician supervision. The program's goal is to rapidly screen and test high-risk individuals, including frontline workers and other groups as defined by state guidelines, who do not need immediate medical attention.The California testing program is supported by Verily's Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program, which provides a secure, connected platform to simplify the testing process, from screening through return of results. In order to expand testing as widely as possible while meeting the needs of different communities, we're collaborating with both public and private partners. With the state of California, the Rockefeller Foundation, and CORE, we are launching six new sites beginning in Napa, Bakersfield, and Oakland to ensure better access to testing for farmworkers and communities of color.Expanding testing capacity in partnership with community-based organizations that have built trust among historically marginalized groups will be crucial to ensuring members of these populations get the testing they need. CORE's outreach to farmworkers represents an important milestone in increased testing availability in rural areas, which are often isolated from major medical centers.Improving the accessibility of our Baseline COVID-19 Program's website and screening platform is also a top priority. The Program is available in Spanish, and we are working on additional languages. We are working to continually enhance access for diverse groups, including people with visual disabilities, mobility limitations, cognitive disabilities, and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. The website has gone through a comprehensive accessibility assessment and testing, with the support of user experience designers and engineers who specialize in inclusive design in accordance with web content accessibility (WCAG) guidelines.2. Local support programs for underserved populations\u00a0- Many local and state officials are creating programs to assist those most impacted by COVID-19, including halting evictions, expediting access to unemployment benefits, and more. These resources are generally available through local health department websites. The state of California has launched a number of relief initiatives to expand protections for the most vulnerable, including programs focused on immigrant and undocumented workers, as well as childcare for essential workers. More information is available at covid19.ca.gov.3. Improving information access - With the continuously-evolving nature of the crisis, organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are regularly updating recommendations. However, for millions of Americans without reliable access to the internet, it's difficult to stay up-to-date on new health information. More than 700 broadband services providers and associations have signed the Federal Communication Commission's \"Keep Americans Connected Pledge\" to expand connectivity. This pledge includes opening Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them for 60 days.To further assist with the challenge of connecting people with reliable, current health information, Verily recently announced the COVID-19 Pathfinder. This digital toolkit enables people to access relevant information on-demand from their providers' websites. The Pathfinder\u00a0has been deployed by leading hospital and health systems including\u00a0San Joaquin General Hospital, Western Wisconsin Health, Morehouse School of Medicine and Morehouse Healthcare and is available in multiple languages, such as Haitian Creole, for broader accessibility.Among communities that have historically experienced more severe health outcomes, COVID-19 is having outsized impacts. As we weather the course of the pandemic, it will be important to continue gathering information on how COVID-19 is spreading, how to identify people who are at risk and become infected, and how to most effectively treat and prevent the disease in order to inform the public health response.",

          "The Public Health Crisis We are in the midst of the most significant health crisis in over a century. COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic, and we have yet to understand how it will affect us today and in the future. The more we know, the better and sooner we can respond. At Verily, we are doing everything we can to assist in developing smarter COVID-19 testing to inform public health. In March, we launched the Baseline COVID-19 Program to expand availability of COVID-19 screening and testing, beginning in California. Verily's Baseline Verily's Baseline platform has been in development for almost five years and was envisioned as a new approach to bridge clinical research and clinical care. The platform is designed to benefit from the profound improvement in computing and the new digital environment, often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A much more interactive approach to discovery is now achievable. Furthermore, a modern health data and clinical research platform can deal with the vast amount of data that must be stored and analyzed to develop new treatments and to understand which medicines, devices, digital tools, and care delivery are best for which people. Privacy and Data Minimization A primary goal of Baseline is to make it easier for people to engage in research so that we can ensure better representation in clinical studies, more comprehensive data collection, and faster evaluation and time-to-market for innovative tools and therapeutics. We understand that privacy and confidentiality of people's data is critical to building the trust of the community we serve. Verily has done extensive work over the past few years to develop private and secure platforms, and has published Verily's privacy commitments. The Baseline platform has been employed in clinical research for years and hardened to protect data and users. Our privacy practices specific to Baseline are informed by the following frameworks: FDA: The Baseline platform is Part 11 compliant, a key component of privacy and security in dealing with sensitive research data regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. ISO 27001: The Baseline platform is ISO 27001 certified to ensure compliance with leading security standards. CCPA: The Baseline platform supports compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which enhances privacy rights and consumer protections. Verily is applying the protections of CCPA across our operation of the Baseline COVID-19 Program. HIPAA: The Baseline platform supports HIPAA compliance, depending on partner needs. With regard to the Baseline COVID-19 Program, Verily is not acting as a covered entity or business associate within the context of HIPAA. Verily employs security controls that map to the HIPAA Security Rule (for more, please see the HIPAA Security Rule Crosswalk to NIST Cybersecurity Framework). Verily strives to go above and beyond the requirements of individual regulatory frameworks to appropriately safeguard user information and to help in this public health emergency. For the Baseline COVID-19 Program, we have committed to minimizing the data we collect for the purpose of enabling this testing and only collecting what is necessary to enable people to get tested. We are committed to deleting this data once the public health emergency is over, except where individuals provide their explicit consent for additional uses of their data, such as clinical studies. To provide context, current expert projections are that this public health emergency will last at least 18 months; because COVID-19 is a new disease, we expect to retain the data throughout this time period to assist public health. Authentication with Google Accounts As we build products that are used for clinical research or healthcare delivery many people have asked why we require that a person have a Google account. As part of the sign-up flow for all Baseline clinical studies, including the Baseline COVID-19 Program, our platform requires individuals to link to an existing Google Account or to create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address) for authentication purposes. This is important for two reasons: Data Security: We need world class authentication to protect people's information. We are protecting health information, ordering tests, and returning health results. Without a strong authentication procedure, unknown people could send or receive information with serious consequences for health or well-being, and bots or fraudulent attacks could be made on the platform. Proven Solution: Verily uses Google for cloud services, including data storage, computing infrastructure and authentication services, as do many other organizations. Google provides best-in-class authentication and has a world-class team of security and privacy experts dedicated to building, maintaining and evolving defense for the Google ecosystem. Features such as two-factor authentication, account recovery, fraud/bot detection, and phishing protection are important. This authentication system enables clinicians, researchers and healthcare systems to securely and privately contact individuals and transfer information during the screening, testing and research process. Google's access to data is strictly limited to the purpose of providing such services. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not linked to a user's Google Account, which is used for authentication purposes. Data will never be used for advertising purposes. The Future We are dealing with a crisis in the midst of a pandemic. This will take considerable work in a shorter period of time than \"business as usual,\" and there are many priorities vital to the public health. Given that the Baseline COVID-19 Program was built on Verily's pre-existing Baseline platform to secure health information, it enabled us to quickly develop a reliable, secure and authenticated site. We feel fortunate that the Baseline platform was ready to go and fit for this public health purpose. We appreciate the opportunity to help people, patients, health departments, clinicians, and researchers deal with this pandemic. We take our responsibility to protect data seriously and will continue to explicitly inform people as we take this journey together.",

          "As we\u2019ve rolled out a community-based COVID-19 testing program in conjunction with the State of California, we\u2019ve received many questions about how we collect data during the screening process, why it matters, and who is eligible for testing through our program. In short, the process is designed to quickly, securely and accurately screen and test individuals with concerns about COVID-19 while also giving state public health officials high-quality information to respond to this crisis. As former Commissioner of the FDA during the Zika virus crisis, I have a healthy respect for the value of taking action to deal with an infectious epidemic. I also developed a deep appreciation for the importance of reliable data to support the best decisions about policy and healthcare. The goal of our work with the California community-based testing program is to rapidly screen and test high-risk people who do not need immediate medical attention, such as those exposed to COVID-19 or frontline healthcare workers and first responders. It is also critical for health officials to have timely and accurate public health data to help determine where the novel coronavirus is likely to spread and where the most vulnerable communities are. While many public health departments have systems for tracking positive tests, more comprehensive information across counties and systems is currently lacking. Data from individual testing sites and aggregate data could inform decisions the local and state authorities will make about social distancing measures and provide a basis to adjust screening criteria to ensure that people with the greatest need for testing receive it. Over the past few weeks, we and our partners have established four community-based COVID-19 drive-through testing sites in San Mateo, Santa Clara, Sacramento and Riverside Counties. We\u2019ve quickly and responsibly scaled each site and intend to launch with three new sites in California this week. As COVID-19 spreads exponentially, we must move fast to stand up more community-based testing centers. On March 31, there were more than 186,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. up from roughly 30 on March 1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As the pandemic continues to spread, hospitals will need to focus on people with significant illness and healthcare workers. During this acute phase, screening less symptomatic people away from a healthcare setting can help avoid spread of infection and consumption of stressed hospital resources. Additionally, a secure and connected system that enables a person to register, get an appointment, complete the test quickly and receive a secure test result can help communities efficiently establish a systematic testing approach. Our Community Based Testing Guide provides publicly available information about what we have learned that will be useful to others setting up testing sites. Why We Need Data for Public Health Because COVID-19 represents a public health emergency, federal, state and county public health agencies are required to track the results of the tests and analyze data about people who are infected to inform decisions about how to manage the epidemic. Typically, there is a significant lag between the return of a test result and the collection of more detailed information, and little is known about what is different about people whose tests are positive versus those whose tests are negative. The Baseline COVID-19 Program\u2019s technology platform is designed to collect this information, which by law is handled confidentially by public health authorities. Anonymous screeners are readily available on the CDC.gov website and elsewhere, and some allow people to input information and find a potential testing site without identifying themselves. These screeners also have an important role in stemming the epidemic, but they do not enable receiving an appointment for the test, nor do they enable followup of a person linked to their test result. Accordingly, we support the use of available screeners, but the Baseline COVID-19 Program has a specific use in the testing and public health ecosystem. Since our launch on March 15, more than 60,000* individuals have completed the public health screener through the online tool. The screener is dynamic and the criteria may change over time based on public health data and directives by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) on populations of greatest concern. As we scale testing at these facilities and begin opening new ones, the triage algorithm will be adjusted in response to CDPH objectives. As a result, it\u2019s possible that individuals who are not currently eligible for testing through this program may become eligible in the future, as public health guidance involving testing shifts. In-depth data on COVID-19 spread and its impact on specific at-risk populations such as the elderly or people with multiple illnesses can help health authorities make more informed decisions and tailor containment efforts at the local, county, and state level. Data can also help determine which underlying health conditions pose the greatest risk to people infected with COVID-19. In the U.S., preliminary data show that those with diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated disease, according to a March 31 report by the CDC. Further data will help validate those findings. Along with increasing visibility into positive results across counties, collecting public health data through smarter screening and testing can also help public health officials see how initial findings map to key risk factors. We will continue to develop the Baseline COVID-19 Program and to share updates on our progress as the pandemic runs its course. We will provide individuals and public health authorities with information needed to improve decisions about individual health and to reduce the impact of the epidemic as much as possible. As the pandemic continues to evolve we will adapt our approach based on data and the guidance of public health officials who have served California well in order to help individuals who need to be tested for COVID-19 while also providing information for the critical role of evidence-driven policy that is so critical to successful management of health crises. \u2014 Robert M.

          "Streamlining COVID-19 screening, testing, and return of results is a significant challenge nationwide. The California community-based COVID-19 testing program with support from Verily's Project Baseline has rapidly and responsibly rolled out four testing sites in two weeks, testing more than 3700 individuals to-date*. Our team has learned a lot in the early days of this program and has established best practices to inform development of additional testing sites. We are now sharing these learnings to support other organizations' efforts, who may find the information useful, as they expand testing within their own communities. The COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Program Guide is designed to help government officials, public health departments, and local communities establish drive-through testing sites, and includes instructions for integrating with the Baseline COVID-19 Program. The guide consists of lessons we believe may help communities that are under immense pressure to quickly establish testing. The COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Program Guide includes a framework for: Launching sites within a one-week timeframe Optimizing site operations for more efficient testing, while maintaining safety Creating a more automated, integrated process that spans dynamic screening that can be adjusted based on the latest epidemiology, scheduling, testing, and delivery of results The COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Program Guide is the result of collaboration between Verily's Project Baseline team of engineers, scientists, clinical operations specialists, and more, and the California Department of Public of Health (CDPH), California Department of Health and Human Services (CDHHS), California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and county and city departments of public health. The guide also includes clinical and operational input from Stanford Medicine, based on its testing protocols and experience addressing COVID-19. We will continue to update the document as we iterate, learn, and launch additional sites.

          "Expanding access to reliable screening and testing is critical to containing the spread of the COVID-19. At Project Baseline we are supporting the California community-based COVID-19 testing program in expanding to more locations, and we\u2019ve created a video to show how testing works. Here are the steps involved in the program: 1. Take an online screener The first step is to complete an online screener based on guidelines from public health officials. The screener helps prioritize testing needs based on direction from the California Department of Public Health. 2. Get an appointment If individuals qualify for testing at this time through this program, they will receive a confirmation email with appointment details, including the time and location of the test. 3. Take the test At testing sites there are three stations: an appointment check, an ID check, and sample collection. In station one, individuals will be instructed to show their ID, keeping windows closed. This helps ensure that this step is done as safely as possible. Once the appointment is confirmed, they will drive to station 2. Healthcare staff will match each individual a lab kit and attach a lab requisition to the car's windshield. This document helps ensure tests are processed safely and correctly. Then, individuals will drive to station 3, which is the sample collection area. Next, drivers will roll down their window and tilt their head back for a nasal swab. Site staff will then ship the samples to a lab for analysis. 4. The results All results will be communicated, positive or negative, back to those who are tested. Individuals will receive the results about 2-5 days after testing, but this may take longer due to lab capacity. If you test positive, you'll get a phone call from a qualified healthcare professional.

          'The California community-based program to test high risk individuals for COVID-19, in collaboration with the Baseline COVID-19 Program, enters its second week of operations with two new testing sites, in Lake Elsinore City in Riverside County and in Sacramento County. With this expansion to the program \u2013 in partnership with federal, state, and local public health officials \u2013 we expect to be able to serve thousands more across four counties in California. In the first week of operations, we scaled testing to 20X the capacity at launch, testing over 1,200 individuals at initial sites in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. Now, we are adding a self-service scheduling capability for eligible individuals to the Baseline COVID-19 screening tool, further increasing efficiency across all testing sites. We launched the program pilot with a limited number of appointments to allow us to quickly understand and adjust protocols and processes for safety and scalability. The program has involved medical centers and federal, state, and local public health officials to identify and to inform best practices for establishing local testing programs for broader population screening. We plan to share a consolidated report on our approach to support public health authorities in their efforts to quickly stand up testing initiatives. The screening and testing criteria that inform the screener are directed by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and are updated in accordance with public health guidance as the situation develops. The California community-based testing program began by testing higher risk individuals as determined by CDPH. Eligibility requirements will continue to be updated based on public health needs and testing capacity. We have identified a number of lessons learned from our first site launches that will help us ramp up quickly at Sacramento and Riverside: Testing site design and flow An incident command system oversees testing site operations. Each testing site consists of a command center for quick decision-making, and "hot zones," accessible to testing personnel in personal protective equipment (PPE) for sample collection. Hot zones are accessible only to a streamlined set of healthcare workers to minimize risk and to help conserve personal protective equipment. Testing site layouts are designed to align with social distancing measures, limiting areas where multiple individuals can congregate. The focus is on establishing drive-through testing sites, as that framework should reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Sample collection has been adapted to work for multiple scenarios, including individual drivers seeking testing, drivers bringing loved ones for testing, and instances where both drivers and passengers are getting tested. Foundational processes Managing capacity at the testing sites is critical to balancing the need for efficiently testing the appropriate people and optimizing precious PPE resources while avoiding overcrowding \u2013 which can increase risk of contagion. We have a dedicated analytics team monitoring the time required to gather samples and other important testing site metrics to optimize scheduling, and these insights will be included in our report. Our goal is to automate as much of the workflow possible. Often, placing orders for lab testing is a manual process. Direct integration between the Baseline platform\'s software and test ordering systems helps get people tested more quickly. Incorporating global best practices Countries like South Korea are establishing sound procedures that we are working to integrate into our operations, such as temperature checks for on-site personnel as another safety measure in addition to social distancing and PPE. As part of the California Community-Based Testing Program, we are privileged to work alongside numerous organizations who are contributing to increasing testing capacity in the state. Thermo Fisher Scientific and Becton Dickinson are rapidly producing critically needed testing kits. PWNHealth is the physician network that approves testing for individuals and provides post-test telehealth consults, and the nurses and healthcare providers from Hawthorne Effect and Elligo are onsite at the frontlines performing tests. Tests are then processed by Quest Diagnostics. Together, with federal, state, and local public health agencies, we are pushing forward to bring testing to the people who need it.

          "The Baseline COVID-19 Pilot Program launched operations this week with an online screening tool and sample collection sites in the Bay Area. The early days of the pilot have been focused on an end-to-end protocol and playbook that can scale. A critical part of this process is adjusting the screening and scheduling of individuals to prioritize those at highest risk, as identified by the CA Department of Public Health (CDPH), to match with testing supply and lab analysis capacity and to prevent on-site congestion \u2013 work that is facilitated through the Baseline Platform. Our team is working in partnership with local, state, and federal public health officials to rapidly establish a robust public health delivery framework that could extend to other sites. We've learned a lot over the past few days and want to share early results and learnings from our initial screening and testing efforts.* Pop-up testing sites We've established multiple Bay Area sites, staffed by healthcare professionals and Verily team members, including two large expo centers that facilitate drive through screening and sample collection. In the first days of on-site testing, more than 130 individuals were tested, with over 350 more scheduled for appointments this week. Our lab partners are analyzing the samples, and we expect the results to be available for those already tested in the coming days. Online triage tool More than 12,000 individuals have completed the public health screener through the online tool since launch. The screener is dynamic and the criteria may change over time based on epidemiological data and government directives. As we scale testing at these facilities and begin opening new ones, we will be adjusting the triage algorithm in response to CDPH objectives. This program is meant to reduce the burden on our hospital system and is complementary to testing happening in a clinical care situation. People with acute symptoms need acute triage and should not visit the sample collection sites, as the sites are not prepared to provide medical care. In order to safely execute each part of our workflow, we are continuing to make improvements and adapt on-site as we learn, while focusing on protecting individual privacy and ensuring safety for the teams. Building on learnings from these critical first few days, we expect an increase in our testing capacity in the coming days. Please check back for updates on the Baseline COVID-19 Pilot Program at projectbaseline.com/studies/covid-19/. * Note, statistics are based on data collected as of Wednesday, March 17, 2020.",

          "In the early days of this pandemic, Verily - like so many around the world - watched with great concern as COVID-19 took hold in Asia. As the virus spread across the globe, it was clear that COVID-19 was overwhelming countries, regardless of preparedness. As a group of scientists, clinicians, and engineers, we began to contemplate what we could do to support a critical public health crisis. In conversation with federal, state, and county agencies, we heard about the primary roadblocks to respond, including scalable risk screening, testing capacity, and concerns of an overburdened healthcare system whose focus needed to be treating severe cases. Of immediate concern was the ability to triage individuals at high risk of exposure and high morbidity. We were asked by the agencies to contribute in any way we could, and our team at Verily moved with great urgency to develop The Baseline COVID-19 Pilot Program in response. We needed a system that enabled authorized collection and secure storage of health information, and so we employed the existing Project Baseline platform, which is purpose-built for this use. This enabled us to move rapidly to construct a dynamic screening tool, which could scale over time. For the pilot, we have worked in partnership with public health agencies, the California Governor's office, and the California Department of Public Health. The goal was to identify people, starting in the Bay Area, who were at high risk for COVID-19 but did not require immediate medical attention. The screener can change responsively based on epidemiological data and direction from the government on the populations of greatest concern. However, screening on its own is not enough in the current environment, and we have worked in conjunction with state and local officials to secure and stand up collection sites for testing and to close the loop on scheduling through the Baseline platform. At the screening sites, qualified healthcare professionals from our partners can collect samples from those deemed high risk, with results returned back to the individual. Our pilot program launched on Monday with considerable effort by an extraordinary group of Verily, Google, and Alphabet volunteers working with our testing partners and state and local authorities. Three drive-through collection sites were established in a matter of days: one in San Mateo County and two in Santa Clara County. We are actively filling the testing appointments and are ramping up to increase capacity. These onsite efforts have been developed by Verily team members with experience in rapid response, laboratory management, and field operations. We are already working with the government to identify new site locations and to develop site playbooks in order to expand these services to more members of the community in the coming weeks and months. At the heart of everything that we do at Verily is a strong commitment to the privacy and security of our users and their data. We recognize that health data is precious, and we are unwilling to sacrifice protections that safeguard people's privacy, no matter how quickly we need to move. At Verily, we comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations that govern data privacy and security, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The data we are collecting for this Baseline COVID-19 testing program is stored in advanced systems with security and privacy protocols. Data privacy and security is an expansive topic, and we have included several frequently asked questions regarding our own policies below. At Verily, we aim to make health data useful so people can live healthier lives and in a time of public health crisis, we are proud to be doing our part to increase our collective capacity to respond. FAQ Why does the program require consent/authorization? Authorization is required to collect, use and share information and must be provided before screening begins. The services the Baseline COVID-19 Program is providing inherently require the limited and responsible sharing of information with other groups. For example, we need to share this information with companies that are performing the testing onsite or laboratories that are running the test. This sharing is fundamental to the coordination of services to make sure the right tests are done for the right people and the results are returned only to appropriate people. What are you collecting and who has access to the information I provide? The information we are collecting for this program includes basic contact and scheduling information that will be used for the purposes of supporting testing of individuals. Verily personnel and volunteers who need to contact you regarding testing will have access to such data only for these purposes. Verily will also have access to your signed COVID-19 authorization form and survey responses, and may have access to your test results. The information you choose to provide during the screening process or testing process may also be shared with the healthcare professionals at the specimen collection sites, the clinical laboratory that processes specimens, the California Department of Public Health, and potentially other federal, state, and local health authorities, as requested or mandated for public health purposes. Why do I need to link to a Google Account? We're asking you to either link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address) for authentication purposes, and to contact you during the screening and testing process, or to put you on a waitlist so that we can contact you when more appointments become available. Verily is a separate company from Google, and we use Google's infrastructure to ensure safe encryption and protection of health information. Does authorizing data collection for COVID-19 screening program give Verily consent to link my data to my Google Account? No, authenticating your account and authorizing us to use service providers does not authorize us to link your data with Google account data. We do not combine this data with an individual's Google account, and were we to ever wish to do so, individuals would need to provide separate and explicit consent. How are you protecting my data? We are compliant with the California Consumer Privacy Act and comply with all applicable data privacy and security regulations. We are committed to maintaining high privacy standards and keeping your data safe. Project Baseline by Verily follows federal and state regulations governing the collection and use of an individual's data. The information provided will be stored in a secure, encrypted database. An individual's data collected by Verily through the testing program will never be joined with their data stored in Google products without their explicit permission.",

          "A coalition of scientists, public health officials, and citizens nationwide is uniting in the fight to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. While headway is being made through social distancing efforts, it's clear that a more systematic means of risk assessment and testing is also critical. In collaboration with the California Governor's office, federal, state and local public health authorities, Verily is helping to establish testing sites in the Bay Area and an online tool to increase risk screening and testing for people at high risk of COVID-19. The tool will triage people who are concerned about their COVID-19 risk into testing sites based on guidance from public health officials and test availability. Californians will be able to take an online COVID-19 screener survey through Project Baseline beginning Monday, March 16. People who meet eligibility and requirements for testing will be directed to mobile testing sites based on capacity, where they will complete a nasal swab test. Once tested, individuals will be informed of their COVID-19 test results within a few days. To protect the most vulnerable, the COVID-19 testing pilot program will begin by testing the highest risk individuals at select sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, where there is a significant volume of known cases. As more testing kits and sites become available, we plan to scale the capacity. Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase. The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites. We are working closely with Governor Newsom's office, federal authorities and local public health authorities to ensure we have the right capabilities in place to help more people over the coming weeks. Launched in 2017 as an effort to map human health, Project Baseline is focused on advancing science and bridging the gap between clinical research and clinical care. The Baseline Platform delivers the core technology infrastructure to enable decentralized screening and support broader accessibility. The Baseline Platform securely collects and stores health information and is compliant with federal and state regulations governing the collection and use of an individual's data. Data is stored in advanced systems with security and privacy protocols. We're honored to help support such an important public health program. By connecting people with testing when it's most needed, we hope to contribute to the efforts to address COVID-19. The Baseline COVID-19 Program is live at projectbaseline.com/covid19/. Individuals who take the online COVID-19 screener survey and meet eligibility requirements for testing will be directed to mobile testing sites based on capacity, where they will complete a nasal swab test. With this pilot, we have planned a staged roll-out for appointments. Appointments will continue to expand through this program as we scale in the near future. Please note: this program is intended to expand access to COVID-19 risk screening and testing. This program is not intended for people experiencing severe cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other concerning symptoms who may need more acute medical care, as our mobile testing sites are not currently prepared to provide acute medical attention. We are early in this pilot and are going to be learning more that will help refine COVID-19 risk screening and testing. For the latest on COVID-19 screening, visit the Baseline COVID-19 Program website. We will continue to provide regular updates on testing as the Baseline COVID-19 Program expands. What is Project Baseline? Project Baseline is a technology platform that supports research and community health initiatives. We're focused on making it easy and engaging for people to contribute to the map of human health and learn more about their own health. The platform securely collects and stores health information. It is compliant with federal and state regulations governing the collection and use of an individual's data. Data is stored in advanced systems with security and privacy protocols. What is Verily?

          'Facing a crisis in heart disease, then responsible for half of all American deaths, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced American Heart Month in February 1964 "to give heed to the nationwide problem...and support the programs required to bring about its solution." This February, we celebrate the fifty sixth anniversary of American Heart Month \u2013 as well as the fiftieth anniversary of Black History Month. As we recognize these observances, it\'s important to note that there is an intersection between health outcomes and ethnicity within the United States \u2013 one that is particularly magnified when accounting for gender. Since 1964, heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality for American women, claiming six times as many lives as breast cancer. Evidence shows that heart disease disproportionately impacts women of color, claiming the lives of more black women than all forms of cancer, accidents, assaults and Alzheimer\'s disease combined. In fact, black women in their 20s are nearly 10 times more likely to die from heart disease than breast cancer. Historically, researchers largely studied heart disease in men, with relatively low diversity in study populations. The resulting gaps in scientific data inherently constrain our ability to understand and treat cardiovascular disease (or CVD) in women and minority groups. For instance, new evidence shows that women may experience different heart attack symptoms than men, and current clot-busting drugs and heart-related medical procedures are not as effective in women. Despite signs of gender-based efficacy differences, a recent review of heart research revealed that women comprised only 27% of the pooled population of more than 250 trials. It\'s estimated that only 3.2% of women in CVD clinical trials globally are black. Further, existing research on CVD in Latino and Asian communities is even more limited, potentially masking disparities among different ethnic subgroups. Research Goes Red, a collaboration between the American Heart Association and Project Baseline, aims to change these statistics by addressing traditional disparities in research representation. Launched in 2019 during American Heart Month, Research Goes Red is bringing together women from all backgrounds to combat their greatest health threat. Women can participate in surveys and focus groups, contribute data for clinical research projects and test new tools, technologies and treatments in years to come. "For many of us, when we go to the doctor, we assume there\'s an entire view of the body, but especially for women, there are sometimes many unanswered questions," says Nancy Brown, CEO, American Heart Association. "Research Goes Red empowers our growing and passionate community of committed and engaged women to share their health information to greatly enhance what we know about women\'s heart disease and potentially help prevent it." Designed as a digitally-focused study, Research Goes Red enables women to contribute in a way that\'s easy, non-invasive, and meaningful. "Project Baseline is a multi-faceted effort: as a clinical research initiative, a scientific and participant community, and technology platform, we\'re broadly focused on making research participation more accessible," said Jessica Mega, MD MPH cardiologist and chief medical and scientific officer, Verily. "One important way we do this is by allowing research to occur both in and outside of the clinic. Traditionally, research participation can be arduous, requiring people to travel to research sites and spend long hours in labs for weeks to months on end. Our hope is that addressing these barriers will help a broad group of women get involved, in a way that doesn\'t conflict with their busy lives."

          ' Balloons, cheers and congratulations awaited Andy Langford, 67, when he arrived for his annual Health Study visit, after winning a seat on the City Council in Concord, N.C. "I\'m very proud to be part of Project Baseline, and I believe that it\'s making a major difference in our community and hopefully in the world," said Andy. "Participating in clinical research, just like being an elected official, is a way for me to give back to my community." Andy has a long history of community service. Recently retired after 42 years as a United Methodist minister, he began participating in clinical research studies in 2009 at the Duke School of Medicine site in Kannapolis, where he enrolled in Project Baseline. Running for elected office wasn\'t on Andy\'s "bucket list," he jokes. When a City Council member and good friend passed away unexpectedly, Andy conducted the funeral service. Friends and family began to encourage him to run for his friend\'s seat. Four months later, Andy won election to a four-year term in Concord, a city with a population nearing 100,000. He was sworn into office on Dec. 12. "Project Baseline and ministry and now elected office \u2013 they are all the same things, just different dimensions of public service," he said. His campaign motto was simple. "I will listen, I will study hard, and I will make hard decisions." Andy estimates that he talked to thousands of voters during the campaign, and their requests were often related to health and wellness. "They want more parks, greenways and bike lanes and better access to healthcare. It\'s about quality of life and healthy living," he said. "That echoes Project Baseline, which is about giving back and serving the whole person, serving every constituency. Just like serving on City Council."',

          "Double down was one of the 200-year old Collins Dictionary's top words of the year for 2019. Doubling down \u2013 \"reinforcing one's commitment to an idea\" \u2013 also feels fitting for this year at Project Baseline. Together with participants from all walks of life, Project Baseline was created to shed light on little-understood health areas \u2013 much as centuries of exploration yielded an accurate map of the world. With new science and technology, we hope to move faster and create a map of human health that has the potential to impact humanity within our lifetimes. 2019 was a year of doubling down on this vision to further define that map. As the year comes to a close, we're counting down some of the Project Baseline community's most memorable moments. We also asked industry leaders: what are your predictions for healthcare, and Project Baseline's role, in 2020? 10. Expanding the map of human health Heart disease is America's greatest health threat, and a core focus for Project Baseline. Research Goes Red, our collaboration with the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement, launched this year to improve women's representation in heart research. Research Goes Red was followed by the Heart Biomarker Study, an initiative to advance research around Lp(a), an emerging key risk factor for heart disease. Along with heart research, we significantly expanded Project Baseline's map to include sleep, gut, and mood research. We look forward to learning even more in 2020! 9. Announcing the Baseline Platform and Health Systems Consortium Driving meaningful change in research requires partnering across the healthcare ecosystem. The new Baseline Health System Consortium is focused on improving collaboration across key healthcare stakeholders, including top academic medical centers and healthcare systems, to address shared challenges in research. We also announced strategic alliances with top biopharmaceutical organizations to develop innovative, patient-centered research programs using the Baseline Platform. The Baseline Platform is designed to improve research participation and collect richer data \u2013 including outside of a clinical setting. 8. Convening the Project Baseline Advisory Board Along with forging connections across healthcare, we want to ensure that a broad spectrum of perspectives is represented within Project Baseline. In 2019, we convened an Advisory Board representing patient advocates, ethicists, and leaders in science, public health, and research. Take a look back at Dr. Reed Tuckson's insights on healthcare collaboration, evolving health data, and enabling participant-centered research from Project Baseline's first Advisory Board. 7. Celebrating the Project Baseline Health Study Project Baseline's first research initiative, the Health Study, turned two years old in 2019. Study teams and participants nationwide gathered to mark this milestone, enjoying a day of sharing reflections, making connections, and having fun! Participants shared their dreams for the future of the Health Study, which was created to better understand disease by collecting rich data from diverse participants over the course of four years. Dreams for the Health Study included: Find a cure and help prevent diseases Provide better understanding of human health Help advance health for all diverse groups Help me be on top of my health Detect health issues before they become serious Discover valid patterns that lead to cure 6. Taking Project Baseline on the road Project Baseline crossed the country this year to share insights on making research more accessible. Notably, we discussed empowering people to own their health data at Austin's South by Southwest, keeping patients informed at Patients as Partners in Philadelphia, and closing the gap between research and care at HLTH in Las Vegas. 5. Meeting the Project Baseline team Project Baseline is a collaboration that brings together many different groups \u2013 including researchers, clinicians, engineers, designers, patient advocates, participants, and more \u2013 to better understand human health. This year, we introduced the world you to some of the key members of the Project Baseline team. Each contributes an essential piece of our mission, from analyzing health data to ensuring that our tools and technologies meet participants' needs. Get to know some of the people who make Project Baseline a reality: User experience (UX) designers and researchers The Project Baseline Support team\u00a0 Microbiome researchers and cardiologists 4. Participants tangibly advancing science Within Project Baseline, participants and researchers collaborate to make data better and more actionable. Driven by participant feedback on the precision of daily step counts, the Project Baseline data team was able to update a motion-tracking algorithm to improve accuracy. Using machine learning, this algorithm is designed to analyze and derive insights from data, helping researchers establish what \"normal\" movement really looks like. 3. Returning results Typically, research participants have limited visibility into study outcomes and how their data are used in research. This is where Project Baseline comes in. We're thinking through how to return data thoughtfully, ethically, and responsibly \u2013 all while exploring what it means to conduct truly human-centric research. This year, we returned detailed reports of Health Study participants' individual physical fitness data, as well as genetic information. 2. Spotlighting real research participants One of the greatest highlights of our year is getting to know our participants, known within our community as Baseline Explorers. This year, we got to meet Nor and Trell, advocates for human health research. We also met a number of Baseline Explorers who shared why research matters \u2013 both to individual participants, and the world that benefits from scientific advancement. Check out their stories on YouTube. 1. Building community Realizing the promise of research hinges on partnering with participants. We're thrilled to see the vibrancy and engagement of the Project Baseline community as the initiative grows. None of this would be possible without the work of our participants and study teams. Looking forward to 2020, we asked our team: how do you see Project Baseline, and healthcare, evolving in the year to come? \"Getting potentially life-saving treatments to the people that need them hinges on connecting science to people's daily lives, in a way that's seamless and easy for them. In the coming year, we aim to break down traditional barriers to joining and participating in studies. With the expansion of Project Baseline to new health areas, we're learning about how we can reduce the complexity of navigating research to help people access the opportunities they need. We're also continuing to focus on enabling people to generate scientific data in real-world settings \u2013 whether by wearing unobtrusive sensors, or participating from the comfort of their own homes.\" - Casimir Starsiak, Product Lead \"Growing the community and ecosystem of Project Baseline is critical to engaging real people in research. Earlier this year, we announced the Project Baseline Health Systems Consortium, an effort to identify the biggest challenges in research. In 2020, the consortium will explore the use of new tools and technology to improve research broadly, including better matching of participants and clinicians with research opportunities. We also look forward to building on our partnerships with patient advocacy groups and industry-leading life sciences organizations to establish important research initiatives driven by the patient voice.\" - Ashley Moulton, Engagement Lead \"The Baseline Health Study is an incredibly diverse cohort that includes both healthy people and people at various stages of disease. As we begin to evaluate the relationship between digital biomarkers and health and disease, I think we may find that the digital signal has different value and different meaning in healthy people, particularly younger, healthier people, versus older people with greater disease burden.\" - Dave Miller, Head of Biostatistics and Epidemiology",

          "Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. While a growing national dialogue around mental health means awareness of mood disorders is higher than ever, there's still much we don't know about the science of depression. To better understand mental health \u2013 through rigorous, real-world measurement \u2013 the Project Baseline Mood Study is exploring how smartphone data could uncover more objective markers of depression. Since the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) survey became a standard diagnostic tool for depression in 1999, new technologies have unlocked a wealth of untapped data that could provide an even deeper understanding of mood. One of the largest studies of digital devices and mental health to date, the Mood Study will enroll thousands of participants to develop new ways of assessing mood disorders. The study aims to gather real-world data in a simple and scalable way that blends seamlessly into daily life. Second-by-second, smartphones measure rich behavioral and environmental information that can indicate changes in depression. For instance, smartphones can detect ambient lighting changes and user behaviors that suggest the user is asleep. Significant shifts in sleep may be one indication of a change in an individual's mood disorder. Along with simply using their smartphones, Mood Study participants will answer brief daily health surveys. The Mood Study will bring all these data together to generate scientific evidence that is clinically trustworthy and generalizable to real-world populations. Today, measuring symptoms and treating depression still rely on traditional and subjective assessments \u2014 with varying rates of success. UC Berkeley researcher Stephan Lammel recently noted that depression treatment is \u201ccurrently often based on guesswork. No one treatment works for everyone, and no one has objective data on how to differentiate the enormous variability of depression symptoms and subtypes.\u201d \u201cWhen collected at scale and with user consent, information from smartphones has the potential to power objective insights into mental health,\u201d says Menachem Fromer, mental health R&D lead at Verily. \u201cThis will require machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence in which computer systems can learn from data. Given enough data, these systems can begin to detect new patterns that are difficult to capture with standard clinical tools. By providing new measures of mental health, this process could fundamentally reshape how people and their physicians understand mood and manage mental health.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re successful,\u201d says Collin Walter, mental health product lead at Verily, \u201cwe envision that one day a person\u2019s unique digital footprint could be used to recommend a personalized, data-driven care path that is most likely to work for that individual.\u201d To learn more about the Mood Study and its mission to advance mental health research, visit our website.",

          " Project Baseline was created to map human health, but who is responsible for thinking about what data we collect to build that map and how to make it actionable? We sat down with Vanessa Ridaura, genomics scientist, and Naxin Wang, data product manager, to learn more. Thanks for joining us, both! Can you talk a little bit about your background and what you focus on within Project Baseline? Vanessa: I'm a senior scientist and technical lead for Project Baseline's microbiome efforts, which means I'm focused on using science and technology to understand how the microorganisms associated with the human body, known as the human microbiome, impact our health. I'm also responsible for Project Baseline's science strategy more broadly, including the tools and processes we use to study humans on a molecular level. Naxin: I'm a product manager, focused on data collection and analysis within the Baseline Platform. Broadly, I work on ensuring we have the right data streams to help researchers understand health and making that data useful for analysis. This can include everything from traditional clinical data, like test results and other medical information, to more novel data streams like sensor data and historical information like electronic health records. What are some of the challenges that go into collecting this data? Naxin: One of the biggest data challenges, especially with novel sources of data, is context. For example, with data from the Study Watch \u2013 a sensor used in the Project Baseline Health Study that captures activity information \u2013 we know you're moving, but are you walking or are you riding a bike? We handle these questions by making our algorithms and devices smarter and more effective over time, as well as by working directly with participants. Both of you are dedicated to creating insights from health data. How do we align on which types of data we want to collect? Naxin: We start by understanding why this data is useful for understanding health by working with scientists like Vanessa, biostatisticians, clinicians, patient advocacy groups and other industry experts. Then we turn to how we can actually gather a particular data type\u2013some methods are more feasible than others. For example, within the Health Study, we decided to begin collecting geolocation data because participants can share it in an easy and seamless way if they choose to\u2013and evidence suggests that physical location can have a significant impact on health outcomes. To move science forward, however, it's not just about how much data we can gather. We also need to organize and unify this data to make it meaningful. Vanessa: Exactly. From a scientific perspective, data starts to become valuable and interesting when we can bring it together to get a holistic look at human health. Traditionally, most of us have a point-in-time-snapshot of our health based on clinical labs. But with a broader set of data, we can start to make comparisons and explore relationships between different processes in the body. For instance, what effect do nutrition, activity level, and genetics have on our microbiome? How does each affect the other and what's the net impact on health? These are some of the questions we can begin to explore.",

          'Genetic research is focused on pinpointing the slight variations in DNA that can cause serious, even life-threatening disorders. There are more than 6,000 known genetic disorders today, and we\'re just at the beginning of understanding the complex interplay of genes, environment, and lifestyle on human health. By collecting in-depth data from diverse individuals over time, the Project Baseline Health Study aims to precisely define the "baseline" of good health. Equally important, Project Baseline is focused on approaching the practice of science in a new way, sharing the results of research with individual participants. This month, in partnership with Color, Project Baseline is returning genetic information to Health Study participants interested in learning more about their inherited risk for heart disease, certain cancers, and how they may respond to medications. Through a simple, non-invasive saliva test, participants can learn about their genes \u2013 one of the top-requested areas for receiving personal results \u2013 without the need to travel to a lab. "Genetics are an important way that we understand disease risk, and it\'s critical to the Health Study to look at data on many biological levels," said Dr. Megan Rothney, program manager of the Project Baseline Health Study. "By bringing this information together with other health data, we can better understand how genetics may relate to lifestyle and other risk factors. So this is another layer we can use to build a detailed map of human health." Beyond research, context is also helpful for understanding the impact of genetics on an individual\'s overall health. While consumer demand for genetic information is growing, it\'s important to note that genetic risk alone is not necessarily a predictor of developing a condition. When viewed side-by-side with other risk factors, genetics can enable precision medicine: a personalized care plan tailored to each person\'s unique medical history. "Precision medicine involves finely tuning treatment based on a comprehensive view of a person. For example, say you don\'t show any of the traditional risk factors for heart disease, but your doctor knows you have a genetic predisposition," continued Rothney. "With a holistic view of your profile, including genetics, your providers could give you a different set of dietary and lifestyle recommendations than they might to someone who looks the same \u2013 but doesn\'t have your genetic risks." The promise of personalized medicine is a result of tremendous advancements in gene sequencing, or the ability to "decode" DNA to understand its makeup and identify variations from the norm that may cause disease. Fully capitalizing on this promise requires that progress in technology is complemented by more diverse study populations. "Diseases manifest in many ways, and you need a lot of different people in order to see those patterns," said Rothney. "With breast cancer, for instance, based on markers like estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, we can identify three populations that vary based on risk and therapies they respond to. The more diversity we have in research, the more finely we can define a type of disease and the more targeted we can get with treatment." Classifying the variants \u2013 more commonly known as mutations \u2013 that can lead to disease hinges on including different ancestry groups in genetic analysis, noted Robert Green, geneticist and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. "If we don\'t have access to information from a diverse set of participants we may make misclassifications of variants. Additionally on a societal level, it\'s important that participation in research, and the benefits associated with it, not be restricted to any one group \u2013 be it geographical, ethnic, or socioeconomic." When it comes to sharing results of research with participants, researchers are responsible for clearly distinguishing clinically relevant results from other study data. "Returning results in the research world is complex because researchers are gathering different sets of data," said Green, a member of Project Baseline\'s Return of Results committee. "This includes measures that have been clinically established as important for health, information where there is some evidence but no scientific consensus on what it means, and areas that are purely exploratory \u2013 meaning we\'re gathering information to understand their impact on health. To ethically return results, researchers need to define the categories that are proven to matter for health and note if any data is not clinical best practice." Within the Health Study, the return of genetic information follows the release of physical performance information in Fitness Reports earlier this year. "Project Baseline takes a thoughtful approach to returning results that has grown and evolved over the course of the Health Study," says Rothney. "Of the many considerations involved with sharing data, the highest priority is returning information that may have an immediate impact on health. From the outset of the study, significant medical findings have been shared with participants so they can discuss an action plan with their clinician. We look forward to returning even more individual results \u2013 and research findings from the study \u2013 with our participants as the initiative continues."',

          'The average American visits the doctor four times per year. Assuming each visit takes an hour, this means less than 0.1% of our year is spent with a healthcare provider. The vast majority of what impacts our health \u2013 sleep, nutrition, movement \u2013 happens outside the clinic, in the real world. At Project Baseline, we\'re on a mission to gather comprehensive health data to create a "baseline" that defines what it truly means to be healthy, and delineate the transition to disease. Our participants take a number of endurance, strength, agility, and balance tests at their annual study site visits, so researchers can aggregate and track changes over time. A key part of this effort is ensuring that participants have insight to their personal data\u2013as well as a voice in how it\'s delivered. Accordingly, the shift to real-world evidence (RWE) in clinical research aims to ensure that treatments are proven effective outside the controlled environment of a lab. Typically, however, RWE generation doesn\'t even begin until the late stages of a trial, and often continues after health interventions are approved and brought to market. Could collecting richer data, in more realistic conditions, earlier in the research process ultimately improve patient care? Verily\'s Study Watch1, originally developed as part of the Project Baseline Health Study, was designed to help answer this question. While many tools are available for tracking personal activity, research sensors need to gather a tremendous amount of detailed health data and last much longer between charges. "When designing a sensor for clinical research, we care a lot more about the sampling rate: we want much more data within a given unit of time," said Dr. Megan Rothney, program manager of the Project Baseline Health Study. "We want the flexibility to gather multiple kinds of physiological data over an extended period \u2014 up to a week at a time, with the Study Watch \u2013 so we can analyze it and identify the best opportunities for learning about human health. To truly understand health and disease, we want to pinpoint as many fruitful opportunities for research as possible." The Study Watch is built to pick up a broad range of rich clinical data that researchers can mine for health insights. Beyond movement and environmental sensors, the Study Watch captures electrocardiogram data (or the electrical impulses of the heart), electrodermal activity (skin-related data including signals from the nervous system), and photoplethysmogram data (like heart rate and sleep quality). However, collecting more complex data is just the first step: a key part of better understanding health is creating ways to make that information useful. Within the Health Study, participants and researchers collaborate to make data better and more actionable. Driven by participant feedback on the precision of daily step counts, the Project Baseline data team was able to update to the Study Watch\'s algorithm to improve accuracy. Using machine learning, this algorithm is designed to analyze and derive insights from Study Watch data, helping researchers establish what "normal" movement really looks like. A type of artificial intelligence, machine learning refers to the idea that systems can "learn" from data, enabling them to make increasingly better decisions and predictions. When it comes to healthcare, machine learning may hold immense promise in diagnosing and treating disease. For example, Verily\'s retinal diagnostic collaboration with Google has launched a screening tool for detection of diabetic eye disease. Fed with thousands of pictures of eyes, ranging from normal to severely damaged by diabetic retinopathy, the algorithm is able to assess medical imaging to determine patients\' eye health. Similarly, to create a "baseline" of movement, Project Baseline is training the Study Watch algorithm in partnership with Health Study participants. In addition to generating health data, these participants are also directly impacting the statistical models and technology that make the information meaningful. "Traditionally, researchers would execute a study like this by observing people in a lab, which presents a number of obstacles," said Dr. Rothney. "There\'s only so much we can do to mimic a real-world setting: people know they\'re being observed, and labs can only accommodate a limited number of people at a time. Getting enough data, from study populations that reflect our country\'s population, is difficult under these conditions. What\'s special about the Project Baseline Health Study is that participants from communities across the United States can generate incredibly rich data in real time." The Study Watch algorithm learns by synthesizing many different examples of movement to determine what makes walking, for instance, distinct from any other actions we may perform in a day. Since the Study Watch is worn on the wrist, many gestural movements may read like walking at first \u2013 like driving a car, or cleaning, for instance. The more data we can gather, the more of a pattern will emerge around what the Study Watch recognizes as a particular type of movement. To tag their activities, participants note what they\'re doing several times a day. Participants can "tag" their actions as walking or running, standing or sitting still (which helps establish a resting heart rate), or any other activity using a custom tag. Researchers can then use this data to help make the Study Watch "smarter" and more precise. "I can\'t say enough how important Health Study participants were to this initiative," said Dr. Rothney. "Activity tagging participation was completely voluntary. We are encouraged to see just how many participants are excited to take part \u2013 sometimes contributing up to a hundred tags at a time! The Study Watch team was thrilled to see new tags come in every day, because they\'re essential to the study: more data means the ability to explore deeper and more challenging areas of human health." Moving forward, Project Baseline hopes to leverage this data to advance science around movement disorders. Further, developing robust health-related sensors like the Study Watch can fuel precision medicine efforts and enable more personalized care in areas like weight management, diabetes, mental health, and more. Since healthcare is not one-size fits all, understanding what happens in between medical appointments can drive more individualized lifestyle recommendations. Over time, healthcare providers can see trends in behavior and make inferences as to what they may mean for patients. For example, a sudden change in a patient\'s movement may indicate a possible injury, or the onset of a medical condition like heart disease, or depression. With a ready source of historical data, it\'s easier to catch health changes early \u2013 leading to more proactive care and better outcomes. 1.

          "\"Start with the user\" is a guiding principle in technology, and the foundation of effective product design. In clinical research, however, studies weren't historically designed around participants \u2014 significantly impacting scientific progress. From enrollment to study participation, navigating traditional clinical research is complex, contributing to high attrition rates when participants struggle to realize value from their experience. Today, as many as 86% of studies fail to recruit enough participants, and 30% of participants drop out after joining. Making it easier for people to participate in research, so important treatments can get to patients faster, was the impetus for Project Baseline. But what does providing a \"great user experience\" actually mean in clinical research , and how does this philosophy deliver tangible benefits to people? Realizing the vision of more patient and participant-centric experiences can start with user-centered design. If we applied the UX lens of consumer technology to clinical research, could we make participation more seamless, engaging, and valuable for people? To help people discover and participate in clinical research, researchers and designers on the Project Baseline UX team focus on understanding participants' needs and goals. We sat down with Christine Wu, a UX designer, and Kaylyn Frazier, UX researcher, to learn more about improving participants' journey with Project Baseline by walking a mile in their shoes. How would you define a \"great user experience?\" What are the building blocks? Kaylyn, UX researcher: Fundamentally, a great experience is both useful and usable. You could create something that's really easy to use, but doesn't actually add value or solve a real problem for the user. This means you've created the wrong product or service, while designing this useless thing well. On the flip side, you may have a brilliant product idea that addresses a real pain point, but users can't figure out how the heck to use it! In this case, you've developed the right product ... but designed it in a sub-optimal way. Christine, UX designer: To build on Kaylyn's answer: good user experiences help people accomplish what they want or need easily, eliminating anything extra that could get in the way. Great user experiences achieve all this while also making it enjoyable! It's typical to hear about user-centered design in technology. In clinical research and life sciences more broadly, however, Project Baseline's focus on UX is uncommon. What does \"starting with the user\" mean to you, and how does it impact your work? Christine: To me, this means that as designers, we make no assumptions: we take the time to deeply understand people's needs, motivations, and pain points. Especially when what we're creating impacts how people engage with their health, it's incredibly important that we start with an accurate picture of who we are designing for \u2014 for example, how old are they? Where are they from? How comfortable are they with health-related data and different types of technology? Once we know this, we need to pinpoint any barriers to accomplishing their goals, and how we can help simplify them.This helps us understand their motivations for using what we make. Knowing why someone is interacting with us in the first place enables us to deliver value that makes them want to return. This is why it's key to collaborate closely with researchers like Kaylyn, because she helps us get to know who our users are. That way, we can ensure we're building the right thing, and designing it in a way that suits their needs. Kaylyn: We're fortunate enough to have both dedicated UX designers and UX researchers. This means we can think critically about the entire end-to-end user experience, from understanding what the person using the experience needs, to helping them achieve their goals in the most intuitive and engaging way. We always say that an amazing design sometimes seems obvious. The reality is that to get to that state you need to do a lot of in-depth research, brainstorms, user testing and design iterations, and probably revisit the drawing board with your markers and sticky notes many, many times to get it right! Project Baseline was built around this idea of approaching research differently. We stay focused on this not just by designing for users, but also actively building with them. What does this mean and how does it work? Kaylyn: Designing in a vacuum without user feedback would inherently limit our perspective. There isn't one right way to approach designing with input from real target users. It can take the form of one-on-one sessions where you get feedback from one person at a time, and incorporate their ideas. You might recruit several target users to do a group session and brainstorm in real-time, allowing users to build off each other's insights. We always start with a study plan that clearly outlines goals, key research questions, and participant criteria. A key part of our design process for all of our studies is a form of research called a usability session. Once we have a first pass at a prototype \u2013 usually early mockups of a solution we're developing \u2013 we'll run a few sessions to see how people interact with it. This helps us see what's working well and where people may be getting stuck or need more information. Typically we run a few of these sessions, iterate on the design based on initial feedback, then run additional sessions that same week with the new design. We call this a \"RITE\" study, which stands for Rapid Iterative Testing & Evaluation \u2013 it's definitely rapid! Christine: I have the privilege of observing the studies that researchers like Kaylyn run! Usually I'm furiously typing notes or talking with other observers to decide what changes to make. We often make these updates on the fly so the very next participant that comes in sees a new version \u2013 and hopefully we get closer to helping them achieve their goals! This is where Kaylyn is a master: she's able to rapidly adapt to the new changes during the testing session, and probe to see if it does in fact result in a better experience. Often, it takes many days of research and iterations to arrive at a result that we feel is ready for our software engineering team to start building. Describe how you have collaborated with participants and what the end result was. Christine: This is one of the highlights of my job, and as Kaylyn mentioned, it's foundational to our design process! One concrete example is the design of Fitness Reports with Project Baseline Health Study participants. A designer on the team worked with Kaylyn to run several rounds of interviews and comprehension testing with Health Study participants, which helped improve our data visualizations and identify key features. This input informed the design of the first set of Fitness Reports recently launched to Health Study participants. What other forms can user research take? Kaylyn: What we just discussed is truly the tip of the iceberg; we use all kinds of research methods at Project Baseline. A few common examples are user interviews, usability testing and surveys. However, we also review existing literature, test comprehension of messaging and product experiences, conduct contextual inquiries (a fancy term for asking people questions while you observe them in their natural environments), and a lot more. The most important thing to remember is that the research method is informed by the research question you are trying to answer. A usability test, for example, isn't the ideal method for gauging usefulness or value of a product or service. It is, however, a great tool for identifying tasks that are difficult for users to complete or understand in your product. Interview sessions give you a deep dive into a specific behavior or attitude, whereas surveys shed light on how common a particular behavior, attitude or pain point is across a larger audience. Surveys, however, won't capture the same depth as an interview session. Another crucial component of UX research is creating a realistic environment. For example, to test participants' experience with our Sleep Sensor and Study Watch, we created a bedroom (mostly out of IKEA furniture) where participants went through the activities. What project are you most proud of so far from your time at Project Baseline? Christine: I loved rethinking the structure of informed consent for research study participation! Informed consent is critical to clinical research: it refers to the ethical and legal requirement to ensure people fully understand the study they're participating in, any risks involved, and are voluntarily agreeing to participate. Project Baseline's informed consent was like your standard terms-of-service: a super-long wall of text. When we first did user research, we saw users' eyes glaze over; very few people read anything and everyone scrolled directly to the bottom to sign what they had not read! This is a scary thing, especially because there is very important information in the consent document that people should know. We worked with our regulatory and legal team to reduce the amount of text and surface the information in a way that was more digestible, including adding definitions to uncommon terms and illustrations to help people better understand, faster. Kaylyn: I'm currently working on a new research project to uncover what drives people to join clinical trials, what prevents people from joining clinical trials, and what type of benefits or value is most appealing to potential participants. I'm excited to delve deeper into this to hopefully create an even better experience for our participants! Project Baseline members who participate in product research work hand-in-hand with our researchers and designers to help create the best possible experiences, studies, and technologies.

          "Every 34 seconds in the United States, someone has a heart attack. And approximately every minute, heart disease claims a life. Because heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in America \u2013 and only growing in prevalence worldwide \u2013 leading researchers are dedicated to developing better preventive treatments. For patients who have experienced a heart attack or stroke, predisposing them to subsequent events, these efforts are especially critical. To learn more, we sat down with Dr. Svati Shah, director of the Duke Adult Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic. Many of her patients have experienced cardiac events, and helping reduce the risk of recurrence is an important part of her practice. Now, Dr. Shah shares her path toward caring for patients with heart-related genetic disorders, and the promise of new research. Tell us about your background. What drew you to cardiology and genetics? My passion for research was sparked in college, and I actually studied public health before I went to medical school because I wanted to learn how to do good research. When I was in training to become a cardiologist, I was shocked at how many patients were having heart attacks at an early age, and how your family history had a very strong influence on that. Since then, I have been researching genetic and other risk factors for heart attacks, and I take care of patients who have genetic heart disorders. It's very inspiring work because patients want to know why they have heart disease \u2013 and, often more importantly to them, how to reduce risk for their family members. How did you get involved with Project Baseline? As a scientist and doctor, my focus is on genetics, disease prevention, and getting more predictive about health. I wanted to help break new ground on human health through a study that was the first of its kind: the Project Baseline Health Study. As a longitudinal study focused on gathering complex health data from diverse patients nationwide, the Health Study was unique. I became a principal investigator on the Health Study in 2017, and because of my cardiology background, partnering on the Heart Biomarker Study was a natural progression. The Heart Biomarker Study is an effort to better understand lipoprotein(a), a genetic risk factor for heart disease. Along with my work on the study, I also have a laboratory within the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute that uses new technologies to study DNA and molecules circulating in the blood. Studying an individual's unique footprint of blood particles can reveal what diseases they may be predisposed to, and how best to treat them \u2013 far more detailed information than we would typically learn during a medical appointment. Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is one of these molecules. I believe strongly that exploring heart disease through the Heart Biomarker Study can help move precision medicine and personalized care forward. On that note, what is Lp(a)? Why is understanding it better so important? Lp(a) (pronounced L-P-little-A) is a type of cholesterol that circulates in the blood and is not specifically measured by traditional cholesterol tests. Having high Lp(a) levels doubles your risk of having a first heart attack, and also increases your risk of having another heart attack or stroke. In fact, patients who have treated LDL cholesterol levels (the regularly measured \"bad\" cholesterol) but who have elevated Lp(a) levels are at increased risk of having another heart attack or stroke. Can you speak to genetics and risk as it relates to Lp(a)? If we know that high Lp(a) is associated with heart attacks, why do we need more research? Lp(a) levels are almost completely determined by genetics. In fact, Lp(a) levels are actually controlled by a single gene. While it's established that Lp(a) is genetic, and high Lp(a) increases your heart disease risk, we need to know more. Specifically, we need to know if lowering Lp(a) levels actually leads to better cardiovascular outcomes, and when we should initiate Lp(a) lowering drugs. It's an exciting area of cardiovascular research and shows promise in helping heart patients. Is there anything people with elevated Lp(a) can do to lower it today? While diet and exercise are very important things for patients to do to prevent heart disease through other mechanisms, unfortunately, they do not work well for reducing Lp(a) levels. Some of the newer cholesterol medications have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels, but do not specifically target the Lp(a) particle. Talk to us a bit about the study design. Why is this research focused on heart attack and stroke survivors? Unfortunately, recurrent cardiovascular events are common in patients. This is due to many factors and we know some of the risk factors that lead to this, but for a given patient, it's hard to predict with certainty what their risk is. This study will measure Lp(a) levels in patients who have already suffered a heart attack or stroke and try to understand how a patient's knowing their Lp(a) levels might change their perception of their future risk. The Heart Biomarker Study's goal is advancing science to reduce heart attacks and strokes. For patients who have already had a heart attack or stroke, we need to understand what role new risk factors may play. The Heart Biomarker Study gets us closer, but we can't do it without patients: they hold the key. Not many heart patients are aware of their Lp(a) level today, so we're also looking at how lifestyle or therapeutic choices may change once a patient's Lp(a) level is known. Gaining insight into these questions is critical to improving heart patient care. If you've experienced a heart attack or stroke, you may be eligible to join the Heart Biomarker Study.

          "Many of us are familiar with cholesterol as a lab value we want to keep under control. Today, scientists are increasingly interested in a similar blood particle we know much less about: lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Lp(a) is considered an important new risk factor for heart disease, and a growing body of research suggests it may be key to developing more effective preventive solutions. The new Heart Biomarker Study now joins these efforts to better understand Lp(a), specifically focusing on people who have experienced a heart attack or stroke \u2014 a population yet to be fully explored in Lp(a) research. We sat down with Dr. Michael McConnell, cardiologist and head of Cardiovascular Health at Verily, to get more insight into Lp(a) and learn why the scientific community believes advancing research around this little-understood protein could help improve outcomes for the 85.6 million Americans affected by heart disease. Thanks for chatting with us, Mike! To start us off, can you tell us a little about yourself and your journey to cardiology? Sure thing \u2014 my path to medicine was actually not a straight line, since I started as a biomedical engineer. I studied engineering as an undergraduate and graduate student at MIT, and worked summers at a pacemaker company. For an engineer, the heart is actually a really interesting organ: it's mechanical, electrical, and there are fluid dynamics at work. I wanted to explore cardiology and patient care in even more depth, and combine that with my interest in technology. After medical school, I trained at Brigham & Women's Hospital and then spent most of my academic career at Stanford focusing on early disease detection and preventive cardiology. Mobile health devices started to emerge, and I saw an opportunity to use this technology to scale prevention. Traditional medicine is based on clinical measurements, but so much of health happens on a daily basis and in the real world. Currently, I'm working on developing cardiovascular devices and programs to help drive Verily's mission of enabling proactive and preventive care. I also continue seeing preventive cardiology patients as a clinical professor of medicine at Stanford. Heart health is one area where early intervention can make a huge difference. Along with my cardiology background, I also happen to have elevated Lp(a) myself, so I'm personally excited to see Project Baseline undertake this research through the Heart Biomarker Study. Having high Lp(a) isn't uncommon \u2014 it's estimated that one in five Americans has elevated levels \u2014 but more research is needed to determine whether treating Lp(a) can prevent heart disease. Can you break that down a bit more? What is Lp(a) and why does it matter? Lp(a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL, the 'bad' cholesterol that promotes plaque buildup in arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. One important difference is that LDL cholesterol levels are impacted by diet and exercise. Lp(a) levels, however, are largely determined by genetics. So far, we don't have evidence that shows it can be significantly affected by lifestyle. While both LDL and Lp(a) cause diseased arteries, Lp(a) also makes blood more prone to clotting. Generally, blood clotting is a good thing; it heals wounds to prevent blood loss. But what can happen with Lp(a) is that a plaque \u2014 the fatty substance that clogs arteries \u2014 can tear and prompt your body to form a clot to address it. Because this happens inside the artery, the clot stops blood from reaching the heart. Heart cells then start to die, which is a heart attack. A similar phenomenon can happen in arteries that go to the brain, causing strokes. Today, the standard measurements we use to gauge heart disease risk include blood pressure and cholesterol. With patients who have a personal or family history of early heart disease, we may look for other contributors. Lp(a) is one of the factors that may be elevated in patients who have experienced heart attacks and strokes. So to me, there is a large unmet need in identifying who should be routinely screened for Lp(a), and what we should do as a result of the Lp(a) level. Would treating Lp(a) directly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes the same way current cholesterol-lowering therapies do? We don't have enough data to know for sure, but potentially, this could add a critical tool to our arsenal for preventing heart disease, especially among people who are at greater risk. Reducing risk is an important point. Can you speak to why it's important to focus on heart attack and stroke survivors as part of this research? Previous research shows that Lp(a) is associated with a greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke. But we don't know as much about how it affects what we call secondary risk, namely the chances of experiencing a second event. Survivors of a heart attack or stroke are typically having their blood pressure and cholesterol treated and monitored closely. To improve our treatment of these patients, and prevent worsening cardiovascular disease, we want to understand how much Lp(a) may affect health relative to the risk factors we treat today. If you've experienced a heart attack or stroke, you may be eligible to join the Heart Biomarker Study. Learn more and consider getting involved.",

          " Nearly ninety percent of U.S. adults now use at least one digital tool to monitor health\u2014from steps to sleeping patterns and more. But beyond optimizing personal wellbeing, can the \"quantified self\" push the boundaries of science more broadly? At Project Baseline, we're on a mission to gather comprehensive health data to create a \"baseline\" that defines what it truly means to be healthy, and delineate the transition to disease. Our participants take a number of endurance, strength, agility, and balance tests at their annual study site visits, so researchers can aggregate and track changes over time. A key part of this effort is ensuring that participants have insight to their personal data\u2014as well as a voice in how it's delivered. In part 1 of our series on returning results, we covered Project Baseline's philosophy on sharing data, and how it differs from the norm in clinical trials. Now, we'll cover the latest set of individualized health information we returned to participants: the results of their physical fitness tests, or \"Fitness Reports.\" Building with participants For us, delivering useful, interesting information starts by collaborating directly with participants. We aligned on our guiding principles for returning Fitness Reports by interviewing participants and prioritizing what information matters most to them. Our research showed that participants want to understand what their data means in context, and how it may impact both scientific discovery and health. With this foundation in mind, we were able to align on core design questions and considerations, including: Do participants understand what results mean for their health? Do reports answer questions participants may have? Do participants understand what the visual charts are showing them? What data comparisons do participants want to see? Delivering more engaging reports Final Fitness Reports were co-designed by Project Baseline user experience teams and study participants through user testing and iterations. We invited diverse participants to review early designs and provide feedback on everything from report navigation to specific data points. The Fitness Reports cover endurance, agility, balance, and strength. Early versions of these modules included three core portions: a brief summary of the test, the participant's individual results, and a chart showing how their score compared to those with similar backgrounds. When giving initial feedback on this structure, participants found much of this data helpful\u2014but questions remained. For instance, people wanted to know whether the comparison data were population averages or study-specific values, an important factor for interpreting the results. They also wanted a more textured explanation of why standing on one leg, for instance, could be an important data point for researchers. We iterated based on participant input to update the modules with more context all around. When we had comparative data to show participants' results against other \"people like you\" across the US population, we included it, and defined these groupings. We also enhanced the test descriptions to include more valuable information on what they can mean for health, including resources for further learning. The final Fitness Reports included the following categories: Description of the test, how researchers arrived at results, and what the numbers mean Results of each test Comparisons to similar individuals Why this information is helpful for understanding human health Useful information and fun facts about fitness and health Additional resources to learn more The types of information shared and specific components of the reports\u2014such as the additional resources\u2014were often a direct result of participant feedback. Here's what one module of a Fitness Report on balance looks like today: Prioritizing return of results Tackling the challenge of returning results takes teamwork and dedicated resources. Along with conducting participant interviews, we established an expert Return of Results Committee focused on establishing clear guidelines and processes. Our committee includes participant advocates and thought leaders in medicine, clinical research, bioethics, and genetics. Read about progress to date and where we're headed next in this article by Dr. Charlene Wong, co-chair of the Return of Results Committee. Working with participants and experts to share data in an engaging way is one of the most rewarding aspects of Project Baseline.

          "Now more than ever, patients are considered key partners in healthcare. Ninety three percent of hospitals provide patients with access to health records online, and evidence shows that highly engaged patients have better treatment outcomes. However, in clinical research, this move toward greater collaboration is still just beginning. Typically, participants in clinical trials have limited visibility into study outcomes and how their data are used in research. This is where Project Baseline comes in. Project Baseline is unusual because of the breadth and complexity of the data we use to understand human health\u2014as well as our commitment to sharing that data with participants. Because this hasn't been done before to this magnitude in clinical research, there are no widespread norms to follow. We're thinking through how to return data thoughtfully, ethically, and responsibly to minimize unintended consequences\u2014all while exploring what it means to conduct truly human-centric research. From the beginning of the Project Baseline Health Study in 2017, we made it a priority to return any serious medical findings that require urgent follow-up with a doctor. We also convened a dedicated Return of Results Committee including participant advocates and thought leaders in medicine, clinical research, bioethics, and genetics. This committee is focused on creating clear standards that can serve as a new foundation for future clinical research. Their initial findings were published in 2018, and additional guidelines are set to follow this year. In 2018, we also began returning lab results, activity trends, and fitness data with all participants. We're excited to continue to evolve and expand on these efforts in 2019 and beyond. Take a look inside how we're designing our approach to deliver meaningful information. Returning results starts with participants Health Study participants contribute data in a number of ways, like lifestyle and health habit surveys, blood samples, and tests completed at their local Project Baseline study site. These tests can include standard assessments of physical strength as well as more specialized tests like eye exams and heart imaging. Following their initial site visit, Health Study participants receive the full results of their CLIA lab test, which is a comprehensive blood panel including cholesterol, key vitamin levels, liver function, and more. While Project Baseline does not take the place of clinical care, we know participants are interested in what their data may mean for their health. Blood panel results provide a view of a number of health values, which participants can discuss with their healthcare providers if needed. Next, we wanted to learn more about participants' preferences in order to deliver useful data on an ongoing basis. Knowing we were navigating new territory\u2014and that participants care deeply about receiving this data\u2014it was important to give participants a voice in the process. Ultimately, Project Baseline's mission is to make participation in research easy and engaging. One way we're aiming to break with tradition is by giving our participants a range of different ways to give us feedback\u2014from quarterly surveys, to interviews, to regular check-ins with participants from the Project Baseline team. From the Project Baseline enrollment questionnaire, we knew that the opportunity to receive results is the #2 top reason people join, after contributing to research. We probed deeper in a survey last year focusing on what data participants were most interested in getting back. Physical activity data from the Study Watch was one of the top-ranked requests. Data gathered by the Study Watch\u2014a device participants wear to capture step count and other activity data\u2014was also the #1 request from participants in calls and emails to the Project Baseline support team. To move towards giving participants the visibility they wanted, we launched Study Watch step count in the Project Baseline app in August 2018. More recently, we delivered more detailed reports of participants' individual physical fitness data. These Fitness Reports outlined the results of the strength and coordination tests participants took part in during their site visits. Not only did participants help us prioritize the sequence of results to return, they also played an integral role in the actual design of the reports. The result of close partnership between the Project Baseline team and participants, Fitness Reports were delivered after months of participant-focused research and iteration. The process involved rounds of participant interviews, as well as hands-on sessions where participants navigated through draft reports and provided feedback on how useful, interesting, and understandable they were. Participants also had the opportunity to review multiple versions of report designs. To learn more, stay tuned for part 2\u2014we'll dive deeper into fitness data, collaboration, and how the reports were designed.",

          "Heart disease causes one in four deaths in the United States annually. To combat America's greatest health threat, Project Baseline today announced the Heart Biomarker Study to advance research around a little-understood blood particle that's considered an emerging risk factor for heart disease: lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a biological marker (or \"biomarker\") similar to cholesterol: when elevated, it increases the risk of blockages in the arteries that cause heart attacks and strokes. One in five Americans is estimated to have high levels of Lp(a), which are determined by genetics1. And although existing research suggests that Lp(a) plays a pivotal role in heart health, no targeted treatments are currently available. Today, individuals with high Lp(a) are mostly treated with statin medications to manage cholesterol2. As the director of the Duke Adult Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic, I care for patients with heart-related genetic disorders, and their families. Helping patients prevent a recurrence of cardiac events is an important part of my practice, and my core focus as a researcher. For patients with a greater genetic risk profile, I strongly believe that we need more effective preventive treatments. Over the past two years, I've worked closely with the Project Baseline team to determine how we may be able to help improve outcomes for the 85.6 million Americans affected by heart disease. Learning more about Lp(a) \u2014 and particularly how it impacts heart patients \u2014 could be a key piece of this. The Heart Biomarker Study is an observational research study that will collect the health records of eligible participants who have experienced a heart attack or stroke. Participants will also learn their Lp(a) level through a specialized blood test at their local lab. For a cardiology researcher, the opportunity to focus on Lp(a) in heart attack and stroke survivors is compelling. To date, Lp(a) research has not been able to completely understand how levels of the biomarker impact the risk of a second heart attack or stroke among those who have already suffered a cardiac event. One in four of the more than 795,000 strokes that occur per year are actually experienced by people who have had a previous stroke. Similarly, about 27% of yearly heart attacks happen to people who have experienced a heart attack before. The Heart Biomarker Study is specifically designed to help identify how Lp(a) affects this population, in order to better understand how to potentially reduce the risk of subsequent events. To improve health for all, there are many areas that require deeper scientific exploration. Heart disease, which causes more than one death per minute, is one of the most critical. Building on the Project Baseline Health Study \u2014 a landmark endeavor to delineate the transition from health to disease \u2014 the Heart Biomarker Study is an important step in Project Baseline's mission to map human health. Research Goes Red, Project Baseline's collaboration with the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement, launched in February to improve the representation of women in heart research. Now, the Heart Biomarker Study joins these efforts to increase the speed of discoveries, and ultimately improve healthcare. If you've experienced a heart attack or stroke, you may be eligible to participate in the Heart Biomarker Study.

          " When healthcare works, it's the result of collaboration. From hospital networks to health authorities, patients, payers and more, we all share a common goal: improving outcomes. What we're not always aligned on is how to get there. But increasingly, as a result of new partnerships, that's changing. As a physician, I've had the opportunity to engage in nearly every domain of healthcare over the past 35 years\u2014from clinical practice, to public health policy, to academic research, to private industry. Today, I'm encouraged to see more and more blending of expertise across these traditionally siloed areas. According to the American Hospital Association, for instance, seven in 10 hospitals and health systems will increase collaboration with other providers and payers on population health by 2023. Because clinical studies are at the forefront of scientific discovery, I believe research can play a pivotal role in both improving patient outcomes and sparking greater collaboration in healthcare. So does Project Baseline. Recently, Project Baseline convened an Advisory Board representing the healthcare spectrum, from patient advocates and ethicists to leaders in science, public health, and research. This Board came together for the first time last month to discuss how we close the gap between clinical research and clinical care, strategies for making healthcare data useful, and our obligations to participants and patients who engage in research. Our goal is to create an ongoing forum for sharing insights and ensuring Project Baseline stays focused on people. Here are some of the core takeaways from the discussion. Closing the gap between research and care Up-to-date information and clinician-focused resources on clinical studies can be difficult to find. As a Board, we discussed how researchers may be able to create a feedback loop to keep clinicians informed of the latest scientific innovations. Making data actionable From wearables to electronic health records and beyond, patient data is growing at a staggering pace. But as we increase our ability to capture more and more information, do we have a strategy for making it useful? Within Project Baseline, we are working to collect and organize many types of health data, from biometric data, to genomic data, to clinical data like medical images. By marrying different data sources, our hope is to break through silos to understand health in new ways. Staying transparent and providing value to research participants Patients are more engaged than ever in their own health. Within the United States alone, hundreds of patient advocacy groups have emerged as critical resources, especially within the rare disease community. We have a responsibility to approach participants and patients as true partners. Each board member brought a unique perspective on approaching research in ways that truly center participants. I'm pleased to introduce them to the Project Baseline community: About Dr. Reed Tuckson: Reed V. Tuckson, MD, FACP is the managing director of Tuckson Health Connections, LLC, a health and medical care consulting business. Previously, he served as executive vice president and chief of medical affairs for UnitedHealth Group; senior vice president for professional standards of the American Medical Association; president of the Charles R.

          ' Dr. Nor Chiao came across a New York Times story on the Project Baseline Health Study while stuck in standstill LA traffic. She was familiar with clinical studies as a former researcher at MD Anderson Cancer Center\u2014but this was different from any other research program she\'d encountered. A four-year observational study, the Health Study was a long-term initiative to map human health by collecting deep medical data. Still sitting in gridlock, Nor finished the story and immediately pulled up the Health Study application on her phone. "Right away, I connected with the Project Baseline Health Study\'s mission to impact how we understand health, and its longitudinal nature really stood out," said Nor. "You\'re not just getting a point-in-time snapshot of an individual. Rather, the objective is seeing how health evolves over time across thousands of participants." Nor was fascinated with science from a young age and highly driven to succeed, immigrating from Taiwan to Southern California at 8 years old. By high school, she had been selected to attend a summer biomedical research program for students sponsored by the City of Hope cancer genetics center. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, delivered a lecture to Nor\'s program on the transformation of genetic research. "Because of my early exposure to the breakthrough of gene sequencing\u2014and all the innovation that followed\u2014I wanted to be part of this movement to advance human health," said Nor. Her ambitions led her to Johns Hopkins\' pre-medical program, where she earned internships at the National Cancer Institute and Howard Hughes Biomedical Institute. She would continue her studies at Harvard Medical School and MD Anderson. As a physician, Nor has seen the impact of preventative care and early detection of disease firsthand. She hopes her health data will contribute to a more precise delineation of health and the transition to disease. "I\'m excited to be part of the Baseline community," said Nor. "And as a participant, I\'m really interested to get results back and see how they inform the overall picture I have of my health."',

          "At some point in my childhood, I lost count of the number of research trials I consented for. As a chronic heart disease patient with an exceptionally rare confluence of a double genetic mutation, I am a prime candidate for many studies launched at my primary care center. I have a folder nearly as thick as my medical record containing copies of all of the consent forms I have signed over the years. I understand my value to these studies. Not only am I a rare genetic presentation of a common heart disease, but I also \"am rare\" to still be alive. I was born in a small town just outside of San Francisco, in the days before the dot com boom. Both Bay Area natives, my parents were (and still are) incredibly active. My father went all-American in football during his college years and my mother, sister, and I danced at the same studio. My family firmly believes that a healthy mind is cultivated alongside healthy movement, so my sister and I played sports year round. It was, therefore, completely shocking to us when \u2014 at age 13 \u2014 I experienced my first cardiac arrest while running on a treadmill. I shortly thereafter was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a surprisingly common and serious heart disease which can lead to episodes of cardiac arrest and sudden death. HCM affects the left ventricle of the heart and there currently aren't any cures. Without proper screening or family history, this disease is often diagnosed too late. While my diagnosis was shocking to us all, the biggest surprise was that I was likely not alone. HCM is an autosomal dominant mutation, which means that the genetic variance is passed down from generation to generation. However, many people diagnosed with HCM do not have any genetic markers as all (that we can yet identify with today's knowledge). My family was one of the first at our hospital to be tested, as part of a research study, for the presence of HCM in our genes. To our surprise, the results showed that each of my parents carried an identifiable, unique mutation on the same gene for the exact same disease. While my sister managed to avoid either mutation, I received both. The research was giving us a pristine map of how HCM was affecting our family. But while both my parents carried the gene for HCM, only my father's heart showed evidence of the disease. Naturally, we were filled with questions. How had he lived so many years without knowing his heart condition? What did this mean for the future? Was he also in danger of a sudden cardiac arrest? Thanks to advances in research we can now try to predict the trajectory for many people with HCM. For me, it meant knowing around what age I'd be when I'd go into heart failure and require a transplant (spoiler alert: I eventually did have a heart transplant and three years later I'm still here!). It meant having the awareness to test our extended family members for the disease. It also meant taking the responsibility of spreading awareness: that heart disease can happen to anyone at any age, of any race, of any gender, and for various reasons. The importance of heart health lies in more than just prevention: it is also important to know your family history and to encourage friends and loved ones to get basic testing, in addition to living an active and heart-healthy lifestyle. As a patient advocate and a survivor of multiple heart conditions, I am so excited about the work Project Baseline and the American Heart Association are venturing into with Research Goes Red. Because heart disease can happen to anyone, but disproportionately affects women, people of color, and young athletes1, the research community needs to start finding more equitable solutions for all of those affected. Research has saved my life and my loved ones\u2019 lives more times than I can count. I am happy to keep adding to my consent form collection. 1. \"Heart Disease Facts,\" Close the Gap.",

          'Less than half of American women know the major symptoms of their greatest health threat.1 While sometimes considered a "man\'s disease," cardiovascular disease causes one in three female deaths annually.2 To call on women across the United States to join the fight against heart disease, the American Heart Association\'s Go Red for Women movement and Project Baseline are joining forces on Research Goes Red. A heart-health collaboration focusing specifically on women and heart disease, Research Goes Red aims to empower women to contribute to health research. Historically, clinical studies have not adequately enrolled women or analyzed women-specific heart health data. Beginning in February, which is American Heart Month, women can join Research Goes Red. They may have opportunities to take part in surveys and focus groups, contribute data for clinical research projects, and test new tools and technologies in the years to come. With Research Goes Red, contributing to heart research doesn\'t have to involve taking medication or donating blood\u2014just a desire to advance women\'s heart health. Improving the diversity of clinical studies is key to creating health solutions that work for everyone. "This is an opportunity for women to stand up for their health and participate in research that could increase our understanding of heart disease and prevention," said Nancy Brown, chief executive officer, American Heart Association. "We are thrilled to collaborate with Verily on bringing Research Goes Red to Project Baseline, in a world-class clinical research effort that augments the momentum we\'ve built with the Go Red for Women movement over the last 15 years." At its core, Project Baseline is an initiative dedicated to making research more inclusive and accessible. "Through clinical research we have an opportunity to uncover new insights about health, and by making it easy for individuals to participate, we can develop a comprehensive map that could inform treatment or care decisions," said Jessica Mega, chief medical and scientific officer, Verily. "Collaborating with the American Heart Association through Project Baseline will help inform more women about the value of participating in research, how to contribute, and a new way to \'Go Red.\'" Want to know more about how the American Heart Association and Project Baseline are working to improve women\'s heart health? Learn more about Research Goes Red and join us on the American Heart Association\'s Facebook page on February 28 to wrap up American Heart Month!

          'As 2018 draws to a close, we\'re looking back on a year of evolution and growth within Project Baseline\u2014and feeling thankful. Thanks to the efforts of our participants\u2014the Baseline Explorers\u2014and study teams across the country, we\u2019ve grown by leaps and bounds toward our ultimate goal of mapping human health. And there\u2019s more on the horizon. Looking forward to 2019, we asked our team: how do you see Project Baseline, and healthcare, evolving in the year to come? "Over the next year, we will continue to learn about the interplay between physical health and mental health, with respect to both wellness and illness. Evaluating and collaborating with the patient as a whole, rather than assessing one condition at a time, will enable more and more successful disease interventions." - Dave P. Miller, Head of Biostatistics and Epidemiology "Aside from the opportunity to create huge impact within healthcare, the most exciting part of Project Baseline to me is the people. From continuing to partner with participants in our inaugural study, to collaborating closely with patient advocacy groups and other thought leaders, I look forward to growing this community and strengthening the connections between people with diverse backgrounds and expertise." - Kasley Killam, Community Engagement Manager "Project Baseline is creating tools and technologies to collect, organize and analyze health information, including a rich data platform. In 2019, we expect to scale our infrastructure, enable the analysis of multiple health data streams and automate data curation. This will help us advance the mission of Project Baseline." - Dimitrios Antos, Software Engineering Lead, Project Baseline "My prediction for 2019 is greater democratization of clinical research. At Project Baseline and Verily more broadly, we\'re focused on bridging the gap between clinical research and clinical care by using technology and tools that transcend the four walls of a clinic to fit seamlessly into daily life. In addition, we partner closely with physicians and researchers to explore how scientific discovery can be translated faster into patient care, wherever a patient may be." - Scarlet Shore, Product Lead, Project Baseline "Placing patients at the center of healthcare requires bridging the gap between clinical care and clinical research. Through 2019 and beyond, we aim to move toward more accessible, efficient and inclusive research by approaching evidence generation in new ways. This includes removing barriers to participation and ensuring study populations reflect our communities. Ultimately, we hope these changes will help the healthcare industry get life-saving interventions into patients\u2019 hands more quickly." - Jessica Mega, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer We\'re eager to take on these challenges and opportunities, building on the foundation of milestones we\'ve achieved together over the past year. Here are a few moments that stand apart from the rest. 2018 in Review: Top 5 Baseline Moments 1. Baseline Explorers navigate uncharted territory The Baseline Explorers, a community more than 2,000 strong\u2014with many more waiting to enroll!\u2014began returning for their first annual follow-ups this year. These visits will help our researchers track patterns in health data over time: a critical step toward advancing Project Baseline\u2019s mission to predict and prevent disease. Most importantly, Baseline Explorers report that participating in Project Baseline is helping them learn about their health and making a meaningful difference. When asked about the impact the study has on their lives, responses included: "I now have a much broader view of my overall health. Literally being a participant probably saved my life!" "Being a participant has made me more aware of everyday activities and has made me want to be better, to do more exercise, and to eat healthy!" "Being a participant has given me a sense of contribution to advancement in modern medicine." "Project Baseline has made me have hope for my young grandchildren and future generations." 2. More precise sleep data, thanks to Explorers! In partnership with sleep expert and New York Times best-selling author Matthew Walker, Project Baseline researchers developed a sleep diary. The purpose of this tool was to understand how objective measures of sleep, such as information gathered by participants\u2019 sleep sensors, compares to subjective self-reports of sleeping habits. While we are continuing to collect this information from new participants, we\'ve already seen an important result. Based on participant responses, we were able to refine the sleep sensor algorithm to make the data more accurate and therefore more useful for researchers. 3. Meaningful progress in interoperable data Interoperability, or the ability to connect data between systems, is a challenge in healthcare today. Increasingly, patients and healthcare providers are demanding a simple, fast way to marry data from different sources. To help, Project Baseline launched a novel way for participants to share their Medicare claims records with Project Baseline. Our team was even invited to the White House to present this cutting-edge work! 4. Celebrating Project Baseline\'s first anniversary! For our teams, one of the most rewarding aspects of the study was the opportunity to connect with thousands of participants and their loved ones. A coast-to-coast anniversary celebration brought together researchers, participants, and families to celebrate Project Baseline\'s first birthday. 5. Project Baseline in the news Our talk at South by Southwest, Empowering People to Own Their Health, was named "best health-track panel!" Former FDA commissioner Rob Califf; Bray Patrick-Lake of Duke University; Scott Jung, Medgadget senior editor and study participant; and Project Baseline platform lead Scarlet Shore discussed the growing need to democratize research. Project Baseline\'s long-term goal of preventing illness before advanced disease states manifest was also covered in the New York Times. "We have always thought that if we learn more about what your body is doing before you become ill, then we would have a much better chance of ideally preventing or at least detecting things early," said Dr. Sam Ghambir, a top cancer researcher at Stanford University. To hear more from researchers and participants, including Rosa Gonzalez, Baseline Explorer and advocate for minority inclusion in clinical research, check out the full story. 2018 was a banner year for Project Baseline, and we\'re excited to continue exploring the frontier of human health.

          "Shortly after attending the Project Baseline One-Year Anniversary Celebration, and 2.5 years after he began tracking his activity, David Norlander officially hit 10 million steps. At roughly 11,000 steps per day, that's more than two times the national average. So it may come as a surprise that David, a Project Baseline study participant at Stanford Medicine, is 79 years old. In fact, David has been giving other athletes a run for their money (no pun intended) for decades. At age 60, he got first place for his age division in the Silicon Valley Half Marathon. At age 72, he got second place for his age division in the California International Marathon. During his best 5k and 10k, he ran an average of 6:42 and 6:51 per mile, respectively. David grew up in Minnesota and spent his career in the Bay Area as an electrical engineer\u2013or, as he put it, a \"typical Silicon Valley nerd type.\" His work with the U.S. military also took him around the world, including extended overseas assignments in Turkey, Pakistan, Thailand, and Japan. David's daughter is a medical doctor and a Type I diabetes researcher who joined the Project Baseline study in November 2017. When she told David about the opportunity to contribute his daily activity data and a range of other health information to research, he joined right away. David also encouraged his former colleague and close friend, Don, to join with him. Little did they know, a finding from one of the Project Baseline clinical research tests* would trigger David's doctor to perform a series of follow-up tests and, in July 2018, a surgery that likely saved his life. In the months that followed, David worked closely with his healthcare team. All the while, he kept going for runs and weekly 10-mile hikes with friends. David had never missed a day of work in his life due to sickness, and he wasn't about to let mantle cell lymphoma (cancer of white blood cells) or subdural hematoma (blood between the brain and skull) stop him! \"In retrospect,\" David shared, \"It's unclear how long it would have taken for the effects of lymphoma to be noticeable.\" When asked what he hopes Project Baseline will achieve in the future, David replied, \"Finding out what keeps people on a good health path and how to steer people on a bad health path back to good.\" When he turns 80 next year, David plans on running the Avenue of the Giants Marathon in Humboldt Redwoods State Park with his two daughters. David, we're cheering you on! *While David's experience is inspiring, it's important to note that tests conducted in the Project Baseline study are investigational and conducted for the purpose of research, not medical care. Over time, one of our goals is to better understand how to share results so that the information is useful. You can learn more about this topic in a recent blog post by the co-chair of our Return of Results Committee and in this publication by Project Baseline investigators.",

          'A city in North Carolina will celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month with its first ever Latin cultural festival, thanks to a Baseline Explorer who organized the event. Rosa Gonzalez, 57, helped to create the Concord Latin Festival for the same reasons she joined the Project Baseline study \u2014 to represent and celebrate her heritage as a Mexican American. "Something that I really like about Baseline is that the whole project is inclusive," she said. "If you don\'t include a group like Hispanics, you are losing part of the whole picture." Rosa serves as the president of El Puente Hispano, which translates to the Hispanic Bridge, and she certainly views herself as a bridge builder. "We have our own light, and we want to shine our light in the community," she said. "One of our goals is to share our culture with all people throughout the county, and enhance the participation and presence of the Hispanic population here." As not only a Project Baseline participant but also a member of the Community Advisory Board, Rosa embraces her role as an ambassador for the study with enthusiasm. "If I can be part of the solutions for future generations, it\'s a great opportunity," she said. "If I can be a little part of someone else in the future to have better answers for their disease, it\'s unbelievable." Rosa enrolled in Baseline at the Duke University School of Medicine office in Kannapolis, NC. She works for a healthcare system and as a faith ministry nurse at two Catholic churches that serve the Hispanic community. Look for Rosa at the Concord Latin Festival on Sunday, Oct. 21. \u00a1Un evento para toda la familia! (An event for the whole family!)',

          "Getting ahold of medical records can be an uphill battle\u2014often you receive information in the form of faxes and CDs. In a world where digital technology is ubiquitous and central to our everyday lives, access to medical information lags years behind. The systems that hold your medical history also provide challenges; they vary based on which hospital or doctor you visit and often don't allow for data to be shared from one to the other. The ability to connect health data between systems is called \"interoperability\" and is a priority for the healthcare industry today. At Verily and Project Baseline, we're focusing on how we can better collect and organize complex health information for research while empowering our participants to access and understand their own health data. We're excited that a government initiative now provides us the ability to give Project Baseline participants the option to share their Medicare claims data with the study. Medicare is a national health insurance program that provides health insurance to 58.5 million Americans. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the United States Digital Service recently developed Blue Button 2.0, an application programming interface (or API) that enables Medicare beneficiaries to share their Medicare claims data with healthcare professionals, applications, and research programs they trust. This is a novel achievement and benefits many Medicare beneficiaries by giving them access and control over their health information. As the world's largest payer, Medicare has the ability to help transform data-sharing in healthcare. Empowering greater access to medical data enables individuals to play a more active role in self-care, and expands the potential for research. Project Baseline's mission is to map human health. An important component of this is the ability to access historical health data. Project Baseline plans to collect data over four years, but getting data from prior years will create a broader dataset from which we hope to identify trends or indicators in the transition from health to disease. So how does Blue Button 2.0 work? We developed tools to allow our participants who have Medicare as their primary form of health insurance to share their claims data with us through the Project Baseline participant portal. We explain to participants how they can access their MyMedicare.gov portal account and choose to share their claims data. The Blue Button API enables data to flow into the Project Baseline platform electronically. The process is seamless, and it takes participants less than a few minutes to connect and share their health data swiftly. We are proud to surface Blue Button 2.0 to Project Baseline participants and unleash the value of historic Medicare claims data to help us understand the full spectrum of their health history. We look forward to exploring other exciting initiatives in the health data interoperability space and sharing them with our participants.",

          "If you're an avid fan of number and logic puzzles, you've probably heard of Dr. Sudoku. He's a seven-time U.S. Puzzle Champion, three-time World Sudoku Champion, and the author of numerous books and a daily blog about puzzles. Aside from his fame and acclaim, what you may not know about Dr. Sudoku is that he holds a PhD in chemistry from Harvard University, is the head of computational biology at Verily, and has contributed to Project Baseline since its inception. His real name is Thomas Snyder. Thanks to Thomas, we not only have a sophisticated program around computational biology, but also a one-of-a-kind, custom sudoku featuring the Project Baseline logo. Here it is for you to print, try, and enjoy! We sat down with Thomas to learn more about his work and his hopes for what Project Baseline can achieve. Kasley: Tell us about your work at Verily. Thomas: My background is in immunology and genomics. Back when I joined Verily, I led our multiple sclerosis initiative and was involved with some of the initial pilot studies that set the foundation for the Project Baseline study to launch a few years later. I'm particularly interested in developing new technologies to read out the immune system. Your adaptive immune system stores memories of everything you've experienced from bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, to environmental exposures. In Project Baseline and in other Verily initiatives, we are looking at the immune system in both healthy and unhealthy people with the goal of developing better diagnostics and more precise therapies for disease, including understanding why the immune system may be overly activated in people with autoimmune disease. Kasley: You specialize in both computational biology and puzzles. How are these different or alike? Thomas: Both science and puzzles are about problem solving. To get started, you have to determine what you know and don't know about a problem, choose an approach to begin, and iterate on that approach with other ideas if you get stuck. I regularly solve hundreds of kinds of puzzles, but I'm particularly good at sudoku because I can take one look at the full grid and quickly process the information, such as knowing exactly how many of each digit there are in the grid and where the best spots to make progress are. When I look at a scientific figure, the information processing is the same, and I'm looking for unusual patterns that stand out for further investigation. The key difference is that with puzzles, you know there's an answer. With science, there could be multiple answers or one or none. In both cases, the search for the answer should be fun! Kasley: What most excites you about Project Baseline? Thomas: The breadth and depth of data all in one study from a longitudinally-tracked population. A big challenge in science is trying to connect genotype with phenotype to understand health comprehensively, particularly in early stages of disease. Project Baseline allows us start to bring these together, generating hypotheses to explore more deeply.",

Gary just happened to enroll in Project Baseline on his 66th birthday. When the study team at Duke University School of Medicine in Kannapolis, N.C. found out, they surprised him with balloons and a cupcake." "It was a total coincidence," Gary said. "But it became more significant\u2013what better way to get to spend your birthday than with people who are truly focused on you, and to start my four-year Baseline journey? We had a great time." Gary said he joined the Project Baseline study to contribute to medical knowledge and help advance healthcare. As a physician who practices internal medicine, he\'s keenly aware of advancements that come from clinical research studies like Project Baseline. "I just want to feel like I\'ve contributed in some small way," he said. "We usually go through life kind of oblivious to the functions of our body. We just slide along and let nature take its course. It\'s good to have something remind us that it is often behavior that determines health outcomes, and I\'m hoping that my participation will help me to engage in more healthy behaviors."',

          " We have entered a new era of ubiquitous health data. One in which researchers and clinicians have tools to collect amounts of data not previously imaginable. And one in which the people providing the data\u2014whether a research participant or patient\u2014expect their data to be accessible. A transparent partnership between researcher and participant is ideal, and has not always been the norm in clinical research. Participants often take part in research without visibility into their data or the outcomes of the research. In large part, the challenge with disclosing results to participants has been due to having the ability to return them in an effective and meaningful way, the substantial time and resources that are required to communicate results back to each participant, and the absence of guidelines for how to approach the myriad of practical and bioethical issues that arise around what to return and how to return it. The medical ethics of separating research from clinical care has historically been a key reason for many studies choosing to not return their research results. At Project Baseline, we decided that we will prioritize the exploration of providing health information back to participants. We are well aware of the challenges linked to returning results but, in support of our philosophy that we want to take a patient-centric approach to clinical research, we are continuing to work through them. Because no other study to our knowledge has tried to return as many results as we intend to, we are pushing the envelope into a new and exciting area that we believe creates an opportunity to provide something incredibly valuable to our participants. We have been drawing from many sources to design the policies and processes for returning results, and we are still in the early stages. Central to this work is a committee dedicated to the return of individual research results within the Project Baseline team. Our committee includes participant advocates and thought leaders in clinical medicine, clinical research, bioethics, and genetics. The other key stakeholders in developing these policies and processes are the people most important to this health data endeavor: participants themselves. We have sought input from participants in the form of surveys, interviews and user-experience research interactions to help match our approach to participant preferences and expectations, and we will continue to do so. We have also turned to researchers in other large clinical studies who have chosen to return some or no results for their perspective and recommendations. And we have explored what private health data companies have made available to their customers for inspiration. We recently released some of the initial results in the Project Baseline study, which were routine labs collected at each participant's first study visit. We were careful to distinguish that we are conducting research, not delivering clinical care and encourage participants to bring any questions or concerns about these results to their own clinical providers. As we look forward to returning more results back to participants, we are continually incorporating participant feedback into the design of what we hope will be even more engaging reports. We are also building a more sophisticated infrastructure to streamline the process of returning results, both for participants and for our study staff. We hope this work will become an early benchmark for other clinical studies in this new era of ubiquitous and ideally more transparent health data. We appreciate the support and patience of our participants and look forward to sharing learnings with the research community.",

          ' Scott Jung, 31, a self-proclaimed "gadget guy," said he originally joined the Project Baseline study to contribute his health data to a good cause and use cool technology. "I joined the Project Baseline study because I love medical technology, and I love the potential it has for literally transforming and saving lives," he shared. Since high school, Scott has felt passionate about medical technology. Now, he\'s not only a Senior Editor for Medgadget, but also a biomedical engineer by day at a medical device startup in Silicon Valley and a student by night pursuing a masters in medical product development at San Jose State University. "I\'m attracted by the flashing lights. It\'s amazing to see the direction technology and specifically sensors and micro sensors are heading," says Scott. Scott completed his initial site visit at Stanford Medicine and enjoyed the staff\'s enthusiasm. He said, "Each staff member expressed a lot of excitement for the study and was very open to share what each test was and why they needed to do it." This is actually the second study Scott has participated in. A few years back he was a part of an experimental peanut vaccine trial so he was familiar with the general process for participating in a study. Scott says he is driven to participate in studies because of the potential for medical innovation and impact on many people\'s health in the future. We are grateful that he continues to volunteer for science advancement! We are also grateful to Scott for joining our panel at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, in March. The panel was called "Empowering People to Own Their Own Health Data" and examined how initiatives like Project Baseline and All of Us are developing tools and strategies to bridge the gap between clinical research and clinical care, as well as how we can empower everyday people to understand and manage their health. The panel discussion was led by Verily\'s Scarlet Shore and featured Scott, Bray Patrick-Lake, Director of Patient Engagement at Duke Clinical Institute, and Rob Califf, former FDA Commissioner and Verily Advisor. The panel was the first of its kind for Project Baseline and was named the best health-track panel by MM&M. During the panel, Scott shared his perspective as both a study participant and a medical technology expert. Going into the study he had low expectations about receiving any type of results, but after receiving a holiday card with his own unique snowflake he\'s looking forward to seeing what else Project Baseline will be able to share.',

          "It's hard to believe that i's been a year since we officially launched the Project Baseline study and projectbaseline.com. On April 19th, 2017, Jessica Mega, Verily's Chief Medical Officer, introduced the initiative on our blog and we published a press release that began to generate coverage of our mission to map human health. The past year has been full of learnings, iterations, achievements, and milestones. A key milestone was in June of 2017 when Duke University School of Medicine, one of our study partners, announced its first enrolled participant. Since then, enrollment has been a steady focus. We're still actively enrolling participants at Duke, Stanford Medicine and other study sites every day and encourage anyone who is interested to apply. If you already applied, note that it can take anywhere from a few days to many months before you hear from us, so please be patient. We appreciate your understanding and support! Another big milestone was Project Baseline's presence at the South by Southwest conference in March of 2018. We hosted a panel on \"Empowering People to Own Their Health Data\"\u00a0(named best health-track panel by MM&M), our very own Scarlet Shore gave the keynote at the Health Spark event, and we had a tradeshow booth in the Health section of the convention center. We look forward to representing Project Baseline at many more major health conferences. The statistics shared in this infographic are a representation of some of the data we have collected from our participants so far. To give a bit more context to the numbers displayed, we collect data in many formats that you can read about on the study page of our website. Since our launch in April of 2017, that has added up to approximately 6,700 terabytes (TB) of data. In terms of surveys, we collect survey answers through our online participant portal year-round. The blood samples are collected at our study sites, while the sleep data is collected remotely from the passive Sleep Sensor. Data is a hot topic these days and we want to reaffirm that privacy is our top priority. You can learn more by reading the Baseline Privacy Policy. Lastly, we want to express a big THANK YOU you to our participants and site partners, without whom we could't have made this past year's progress. We look forward to continuing our journey to better understand health and prevent disease!",

          'Although they live nearly 3,000 miles apart, strangers Anna Brooks and Justin Dennis are sharing an extraordinary experience. Justin, who lives in California, and Anna, who lives in North Carolina, were each the 100th participant enrolled in the Project Baseline study at their local study sites\u2013Anna enrolled at Duke University School of Medicine and Justin enrolled at Stanford Medicine. Being the 100th is not all they have in common; Justin and Anna are also both 37 years old and both happen to be nurses. Their work in healthcare was a big part of what motivated them to join the quest to map human health. Ever since she was a little girl, Anna has loved helping people. She found her calling early in life when she took a class on health occupations in high school and realized that she wanted to become a nurse. Later, watching a family member struggle with several serious illnesses showed Anna the value of clinical research and prompted her to apply to join the Project Baseline study. "It all ties in. I see what my family member suffered from, so if any of my data can help others, I want to contribute," said Anna, "I just think research is amazing. For me, the question isn\'t why join the Baseline study, but why not? If I can give my blood and other samples to help advance medicine and healthcare through research, if I can potentially help someone in this way, I feel like it\'s the least I can do." Anna\'s family history of cancer and cardiovascular disease makes her participation in the Project Baseline study especially interesting to researchers. "For me, as a healthy person, to be able to have these tests done and to know that the results will be used to help other people and further research and healthcare, that is amazing," she said. When Anna isn\'t working as a cardiac nurse, she can often be found helping patients at an adult daycare facility. "The geriatric population is my favorite, along with my cardiac patients," she said. Justin too shares a passion for giving back and helping people. "One of the best jobs I ever had was being an aide in a special education classroom," Justin shared. "I had the privilege of working with many resilient kids who had cerebral palsy, and that really sparked an interest in healthcare, service, and giving back to the community." This experienced inspired him to become a cardiac nurse and, more recently, serve in an Intensive Care Unit. Justin was familiar with the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular research initiative that transformed the way cardiovascular disease is diagnosed and treated. So when he learned about the Project Baseline study, he noticed some familiarities. "When I went onto the Project Baseline website, I immediately saw the potential of this revolutionary study and was familiar with the all of the good that came out of the Framingham research. I\'m excited to be a part of that in some small way." Justin also shares Anna\'s appreciation for the unique approach of this study to better prevent and detect disease with the help of healthy people. As he said, "we focus too much on people when they\'re sick and not enough on the transition." Justin and his wife are expecting their first child soon, so his weekends and spare time are spent getting their home ready for this new addition to the family. Congratulations, Justin! The last thing that Anna and Justin share is proudly wearing their Study Watch, an investigational device designed by Verily, every day. Justin noted that people often ask where he got it and he is excited to tell them about his participation in Project Baseline. It\'s also one of the aspects of the study that Anna enjoys most. "It\'s exciting to take new technology and use it to help find answers about how diseases progress in the body," she said.',

          'Goodbye 2017, hello 2018! Phyllis Perry (pictured above on right), 63, was one of the last participants in 2017 to enroll in and complete her initial onsite visit for the Project Baseline study. Phyllis heard about the study at a senior center in Durham, North Carolina, where she enrolled at the Duke University School of Medicine. "Studies don\'t always include a group of diverse people, but researchers need people from all kinds of backgrounds," she said. "I want to help people, and if I can help someone in the future not get sick, or help find treatments for disease, that\'s what I want to do." To help eliminate health disparities caused by low representation of African American, Latino, and Asian populations in clinical research studies, the Project Baseline team has focused from the beginning on achieving a sample that reflects the diversity captured in U.S. census data. Phyllis said she has wanted to join a research study for years but could not find one that accommodated her busy schedule as a nanny. The Project Baseline study enrollment fit her schedule, she said, and Duke team members including research aide Cheryl Robinson (pictured above on left), who accompanied her throughout the enrollment, were "delightful." "It was a wonderful experience," she said. We look forward to continuing to enroll enthusiastic participants like Phyllis in 2018!',

          'Project Baseline study participants are finding a special surprise in their mailboxes this week: Holiday cards featuring snowflakes (as pictured above) that we designed with Project Baseline sensor data. To celebrate the season and express gratitude to our study community, we used open-source software to create a personalized, unique snowflake for each participant who enrolled in the study before December and had ample sleep and activity data from their investigational Study Watch and Sleep Sensor. The number of tips reflects the average number of hours a given participant has slept each night since joining the study. The color reflects the average number of steps she or he has taken each day; a darker color indicates more steps, whereas a lighter color indicates fewer steps relative to other participants. For those who did not yet have enough data from their Study Watch or Sleep Sensor to calculate meaningful averages, we created a snowflake using aggregate data from all Project Baseline study participants. This was a fun way to examine the sensor data and spread some holiday cheer to our valued study community. In the future, as the number of enrolled participants grows and therefore our ability to query for meaningful insights increases, we look forward to using the sensor data to better understand health and the transition to disease.

From scientists who designed the study, to engineers who created the participant portal, to the coordinators at each study site who interact with participants on a daily basis, the Project Baseline study would not have made such progress without such a strong, interdisciplinary team. A big recognition to the individuals pictured above who engage with their local communities and guide participants through their annual and quarterly site visits. We thank all of you in Durham, Kannapolis, Palo Alto and Los Angeles who are helping make the Project Baseline study possible! We are sending extra boughs of holiday cheer to each and every one of our participants, our Baseline Explorers. Without them, we wouldn't be where we are today or be able to go where we hope in 2018. We are grateful for the overwhelming interest in the study as well as the dedication of time and effort from each participant. As the year comes to a close, we reflect on some of our fondest memories of 2017: We officially launched Project Baseline! We welcomed our first Baseline Explorers to the study sites to embark on their four-year journey with us We held one-on-one feedback sessions with participants to collaborate on the study experience We look forward to 2018 as we gradually welcome more participants, collect feedback to further iterate and improve the participant experience, as well as start to explore deeper scientific insights. Together with our participants we are well on our journey to better understanding health and preventing disease. Happy (Healthful) Holidays from the team at Project Baseline!",

          'The Project Baseline study seeks to collect health information from a diverse group of people and monitor how that information changes over time to uncover new insights about the transition from health to disease. The information gleaned from this study will help us better understand how factors such as genes, lifestyle, and the environment influence health. It is important to measure health diversity in a large number of unique individuals in order to determine what is "normal" or expected for a healthy individual. Once these measures, or reference points \u2014 referred to as biomarkers or warning signs \u2014 are established, the healthcare community may become better at predicting and possibly even preventing future onset of disease. To make a complete map of human health, the data collected must be reflective of people of different ages, races, ethnicities, geographic locations, and health histories. However, data has shown that research studies are primarily populated by people of European descent with low representation of African American, Latino, and Asian populations. Asian Americans are the fastest growing minority group in the United States, but are among the least represented minority group in clinical research.1 Further, while African Americans and Latinos make up 30% of the U.S. population, they account for just 6% of participants in federally funded clinical trials.2 This is concerning since inherited heart diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), have been misdiagnosed in African Americans because the population is underrepresented in genomic studies.3 Responding to the urgent call-to-action to help eliminate these health disparities, the Project Baseline study has focused from the beginning on achieving a sample that reflects the diversity captured in U.S. census data. Study leaders have ensured that inclusion of a diverse population is a key component of the study design. Partners in the Project Baseline study, including Duke University School of Medicine and Stanford Medicine, which have deep presence and trusted relationships with minority members of their communities, immediately recognized the historic inequalities in research that might make this a challenge, and championed the approach that engagement is a bidirectional relationship resulting in mutual benefit. These institutions and their representatives respect that research participants are embedded in dynamic histories and community frameworks, and have been committed to developing respectful relationships that create mutual value. The Baseline team believes in approaching their work with cultural humility and consistent presence. Education and information exchange are key underpinnings of their work. To create a dedicated conduit to community perspective, both institutions are working with community groups with diverse representation that includes study participants, public health officials, faith-based and civic leaders, and local physicians. These groups have had an active role in helping educate the Project Baseline study team about the needs of minority participants and underrepresented communities. Duke enrollment sites also identified local African American and Latino community representatives for the Project Baseline Study Steering Committee, who help govern the study. At Stanford Medicine, the team has been working closely with local leaders, health clinics, and community groups to get feedback and input on their processes. Additionally, they have made a concerted effort to ensure that their study staff is representative of the diversity of the Bay Area. Meeting people where they are, having boots on the ground, and working closely with respected community leaders have proven to be successful minority engagement strategies in North Carolina, where Project Baseline has two enrollment locations with the Duke site. Learning from these successful models, all Project Baseline recruitment sites have implemented similar efforts. Project Baseline study leaders and staff regularly partner with churches, civic clubs, advocacy groups, and other community-based organizations to host educational presentations and listening sessions. They also work with healthcare teams from clinics serving low income and minority populations. Outreach teams comprising minority community members have their fingers on the pulse of the community daily and bring valuable input to inform the project. These teams are invested in building relationships and maintaining a consistent presence at community events such as farmers\u2019 markets, races, health fairs, and sporting events. The Project Baseline study aims to achieve a new gold standard for participant partnership and experience, reflected by its commitment to respectfully engaging minority participants. This requires a collaborative effort across the Project Baseline study partners and continuous adjustment and iteration of our collective approach as we learn from the study participants themselves. In 2018, we hope to increase the number of community engagement activities and events, and continue learning about the most effective tools for minority inclusion. 1https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092627 2Oh SS, et al.

          "At Project Baseline our goal is to map human health. An important part of mapping health is to understand what it means in the context of our day-to-day lives. Thanks to the innovative tools and technologies that we develop and use at Verily, we're able to do exactly that. We can begin to track and understand how health changes outside of the doctor's office. Holidays offer an exciting opportunity to see how people's habits and thus health can change in the context of life events. Thanksgiving, for example, is a day where most Americans' routines are altered: Many individuals don't have to work and instead get together with relatives or friends they may only see once a year to indulge and relax. We were curious how this particular holiday impacted our participants' activity and sleep habits, so we turned to the sensor data we collected that day. Activity We measure activity through our Study Watch, an investigational wristwatch that participants wear on a daily basis. On Thanksgiving, we saw a 14% decrease in activity time from the daily average since the study launched in April 2017. Surprisingly, even though our participants logged fewer active minutes, they logged more steps. More steps over less time is possible because our participants were running! On an average day, only 0.3% of our participants' activity time is spent running. On Thanksgiving, that average jumped to 2.4%. Whether they joined a local Turkey Trot or took a jog with loved ones, there was a notable difference in activity that morning. Sleep Whether it's because of a big meal or an exhausting day of cooking and catching up with relatives, our participants on average logged 30 more minutes in bed on Thanksgiving night than an average night. We measured this through the sleep sensor that participants place under their mattress, which passively monitors their sleep. On behalf of the entire Project Baseline team, we hope you had a great holiday and look forward to sharing more insights as we continue our journey of mapping human health. This holiday season, we are thankful to our study participants and everyone who makes this initiative possible. If you're interested in joining us in the new year, visit projectbaseline.com to apply.

          'A bit over a decade ago, Andy Conrad and I were lamenting a problem I think of as the "blind men and the elephant" challenge in human research. In essence, because any given technology was capable of assessing only a part of the whole human being, researchers were fundamentally limited in their understanding of health and disease. However, we could clearly see that dramatic advances in measurement, computation and analysis were on the horizon. Although we weren\'t then in a position to take full advantage of these changes, we nevertheless started to lay what we hoped would be the conceptual groundwork for a new approach to research in a North Carolina town called Kannapolis (Greek for "city of looms") that had been devastated by the offshoring of the textile industry. Thanks to significant investment by philanthropist David Murdock and the joint efforts of Duke University and the University of North Carolina system, with Andy\'s guidance we were able to develop a biotechnology and research campus on land that once housed a shuttered textile mill. The first major effort initiated through this center, the MURDOCK Study, is a large-scale longitudinal population cohort study with the ambitious goal of enrolling the entire population of Kannapolis and surrounding Cabarrus County. Despite challenges created by the 2008 economic downturn, MURDOCK is going strong and, with the help of the people of Kannapolis, we\'ve learned a tremendous amount about chronic diseases in real-world settings. When Andy moved to Google, we and a number of our colleagues started to plan a study that would extend this work by "riding the wave" of coming changes in scientific measurement and analysis. Our idea was to characterize states of health and the transition to states of disease in as many dimensions as possible\u2014something that would move us much closer to seeing the "whole elephant." With support from Duke, Stanford and Andy\'s growing team that evolved into Verily, our team began the tremendous undertaking of developing the construct for what came to be known as the Project Baseline study, but in the midst of planning, I departed to serve at the FDA. Upon returning to Duke and joining the Verily team, I found that an astonishing amount of work had been accomplished, enabling Baseline to "ride the technology wave" by combining Verily\'s technological and analytical insight with the scientific and clinical expertise at Duke and Stanford. I was particularly thrilled to learn that the study protocol had been finalized, numerous pilot programs were completed, and participants had been enrolled. Last month, as noted in a blog post, both Stanford and Duke, through its Kannapolis site, have enrolled their first participants. I also met with the Verily Baseline project team to review the study\'s progress. The systems in place for biological measurement, laboratory management and information capture, integration, and analysis represent an amazing display of the deep technological, analytical, and organizational expertise available within the Alphabet/Google family. Just as importantly, the respectful engagement with and attention to the needs and preferences of study participants was inspiring, and the team\'s good spirits and camaraderie made my day. I wish I could name all the people at Verily, Stanford and Duke who have done the work, but I\'ll start by recognizing the leadership of Sam Gambhir at Stanford and Jess Mega and Scarlet Shore at Verily. Project Baseline is an exciting study for multiple reasons. Because of my involvement with all institutions, I won\'t have direct decision-making input in this effort, but I will be its most fervent cheerleader and advocate. The integrative science made possible by combining so many cutting-edge capabilities in a thoughtful way has the potential to enable new understandings of human biology and the subtle interactions of clinical events, individual behavior, and states of health and disease. It will also illuminate new pathways for engaging diverse individuals and communities as active participants in research, and may improve health outcomes, both now and for future generations. In future blogs, I plan to reflect on some of the specifics that make this effort the nidus of a new era of human research.',

          "We sat down with Vanessa Ridaura, a genomics scientist at Verily (center), to learn about her role on Project Baseline. We discussed research on the microbiome, integration of different data types in the study, and the importance of stool samples. Kasley: Tell us about your background and what brought you to Verily. Vanessa: I completed my PhD at Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine. My supervisor was Jeffrey I. Gordon, widely regarded as one of the modern fathers of gut microbiome research. My thesis focused on developing techniques to study how the gut microbiome affects metabolism. We did so by raising mice in germ-free environments, giving them either a lean or obese fecal microbiome from human twins, and then evaluating how their microbiomes responded to changes in diet. We found that mice with the obese microbiome gained more fat than mice with the lean microbiome, even when they ate the same amount of the same healthy diet. However, when we gave mice with the lean microbiome a high fat diet, their microbiome changed to resemble that of a mouse with the obese microbiome. Then I completed my postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health in Yasmine Belkaid's lab, where I started focusing on the skin microbiome. In particular, I was interested in how it can have an effect on inflammatory skin diseases like melanoma and psoriasis. I'm now part of the Verily research team and am excited to use our breakthrough technology and data science infrastructure to answer challenging questions about how the microbiome influences health and disease. Kasley: Where can we read more about your research? Vanessa: Here are a few of my publications: The Effect of Diet on the Human Gut Microbiome: A Metagenomic Analysis in Humanized Gnotobiotic Mice (2009) Gut Microbiota from Twins Discordant for Obesity Modulate Metabolism in Mice (2013) Gut Microbiota: The Link to Your Second Brain (2015) Kasley: Can you explain, for those of us who aren't scientists, what is a microbiome? Vanessa: Sure! The microbiome refers to all the microorganisms (such as fungi or bacteria) that live in close association with a certain environment (such as your gut, your dog's gut, or even a rock). When we talk about the human microbiome we usually refer to the beneficial microorganisms that live in close association with different human tissue sites, such as the gut, the skin, the nose, or the mouth. The majority of these microorganisms live in harmony with us and provide useful functions; for example, they can help us metabolize foods or train our immune system to respond to harmful bacteria. Perhaps it's helpful to think of your microbiome as all the employees with different roles who work together to achieve a company's mission. In this analogy, employees are microorganisms, the company is your body, and the mission is your health. Kasley: Describe some of the things you've been working on thus far. Vanessa: My work at Verily aims at achieving three main goals. The first is to measure. I'm interested in developing comprehensive, high-quality ways to measure the microbiomes associated with different human tissue sites. The second category is to innovate. I'm interested in innovating how we collect samples for microbiome research, the type of data we generate from these samples, and how we store, interpret, analyze, and share the data. The third is to integrate. With Project Baseline, we have a very exciting opportunity to combine many different types of data with microbiome data. From microbiomes associated with different tissue sites, to laboratory tests, devices, questionnaires, and more, we can do a whole genotypic and phenotypic integration to define and describe human health. Integration is key because a lot of research has been done on the microbiome in isolation, but we've never been able to ask scientific questions in the context of all these other types of data. Creating a holistic view is new and potentially game-changing for healthcare. Kasley: We ask study participants to give a stool sample following each site visit. Why? Vanessa: I know it can be an awkward experience, but the stool sample is really, really important! It will give so much information about how the gut microbiome and health are related. There has been a lot of research in the last ten years showing that the gut microbiome can affect your whole body, from local gene expression to mood changes. It's also unique to you, because it's shaped by your body and your everyday choices like diet, exercise, and sleep\u2014no two microbiomes are the same, even between identical twins. I'm very excited about the scientific insights we'll be able to gather with the stool samples collected over time, rather than just once. If you imagine watching a movie of how your microbiome changes over time, it may be that one microorganism is the main character at a certain point in time, but it's replaced by a new character right before you get sick. We'll miss these important plotlines unless we watch the whole movie. Kasley: What's the rumor about frozen bananas? Vanessa: Here at Verily, we've been obsessed with making sure the stool samples arrive at our lab frozen. If they're not frozen, we'll miss out on a lot of useful information. So we've been testing different kinds of stool kits. One of the ways we tested shipping logistics and packaging was by putting frozen bananas in kits with temperature sensors to see how long the bananas remained frozen, how much the temperature changed, and how many ice packs we need to keep the sample frozen as long as possible. We've even mailed these bananas across the country to test their stability\u2014that's how much we care about the stool samples! Kasley: What most excites you about Project Baseline? Vanessa: This study will provide the multidimensional, long-term context we need to better understand health and disease. Using this complex dataset from each of our dedicated participants, we'll be able to ask questions like what a healthy microbiome looks like, how to design interventions to shift microbiomes to a healthy state, and how changes in the microbiome are related to changes in the rest of the body. There are so many pieces to the puzzle of health. I'm excited to contribute my piece and see how the microbiome fits into the whole puzzle.",

          "This post was originally published on the Duke University School of Medicine blog. Duke University School of Medicine today launched the Project Baseline study in North Carolina with the enrollment in Kannapolis of Duke's first participant. The study is the first initiative of Project Baseline, an ambitious effort to develop a well-defined \"baseline\" of human health, and a rich data platform to help researchers better understand health and disease and the transitions between them. Saying he wanted to contribute to a more profound understanding of why people get sick, a Landis, North Carolina resident in his 60s began the comprehensive study assessments at 10 a.m. Thursday, June 29 at Duke's clinical research office in Kannapolis. Surrounded by a team of researchers and technicians, the volunteer began a unique journey that will span at least four years and include study visits, donation of his biological samples and health information, imaging and other clinical tests, and data collection by a study watch, mobile app and other sensors. Duke will enroll approximately 1,000 participants at two locations in North Carolina \u2014 in Kannapolis at the North Carolina Research Campus, as well as in Durham at Duke University Medical Center. Community advisory boards in both Kannapolis and Durham will provide crucial guidance to investigators to maintain the participant-centric mission of the study and ensure its success. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, a resident of the United States, able to speak and read English or Spanish, and not severely allergic to nickel or metal jewelry may register online at projectbaseline.com to enroll in the Project Baseline registry and be considered for the study. Importantly, participants will be partners in all aspects of the study, having a voice in the direction of the study as members of committees with direct access to study leadership. A team of more than 40 people at Duke has worked for four years with partners at Stanford Medicine, Verily and Google to develop the Project Baseline study, which will enroll approximately 10,000 people and follow them for at least four years. \"The enrollment of Duke's first participant is a tremendous milestone and testament to a collaboration between Duke, Stanford, Verily and Google, and, most importantly, our communities, that will bring together experts from academia, medicine, science, technology, engineering and design with participant partners to create a map of human health and potentially identify new warning signs for disease,\" said L. Kristin Newby, MD, MHS, a Duke cardiologist and the principal investigator for the Duke site. P. Kelly Marcom, MD, a Duke oncologist, is the co-principal investigator, and Paul T. Campbell, MD, a cardiologist in Concord, North Carolina, is the site investigator for the Kannapolis location, where Duke enrolled its first participant. Only through the generous, ongoing participation of thousands of volunteers at Duke and elsewhere can the Project Baseline study hope to reach its ambitious goals. With the enrollment of Duke's first participant, North Carolina's role in the journey to map human health has begun. To learn more, visit projectbaseline.com.",

          "The field of medicine is ever-evolving, and the hope is that recent advances in technology will continue to spur the next generation of medical discoveries. At Verily, we have been focused on creating new tools to collect and organize information in ways previously not possible so that we can make the information useful. These initiatives, we believe, may chart a course towards the ultimate goal of improving human health. Our aim with Project Baseline is to contribute meaningfully to these efforts and to scientific research more broadly. The Project Baseline study will collect a comprehensive set of health information both within and outside the four walls of a clinic. Within the clinic, a broad group of participants - including those who are exceptionally healthy, at-risk of disease, and with overt disease - will be providing deep data on a diverse set of measurements with repeat sampling over the course of four years. To bridge these encounters, we have also developed tools such as the investigational Study Watch and the Baseline mobile app to allow participants to provide more continuous insights throughout their everyday lives. That means the Project Baseline study dataset will include clinical, molecular, imaging, self-reported, behavioral, environmental, sensor and other health-related measurements. To organize this information, we are creating an infrastructure that can process multi-dimensional health data \u2013 much of which have never been combined for an individual. Our vision is that this data platform can serve as a single query source and may be used for more seamless data integration and collaboration. We recognize that we cannot achieve this vision in a silo. Teams across Verily have united around the Project Baseline study, and we work closely with Duke University School of Medicine and Stanford Medicine, as well as other partners from academia, medicine, science, patient-advocacy, engineering and design. In the future, the intent is to make de-identified data from the Project Baseline study available to qualified researchers to spur new ideas across the broad ecosystem. Importantly, the participants are at the center of this study. They will serve as active collaborators alongside the rest of the Project Baseline study team and have the option to receive certain health data and test results to share with a doctor. The Project Baseline study is therefore a united effort to map human health. To achieve this goal, we are creating a new set of tools for medical discovery, with the aspiration that these tools and others from the broader community will pave the way for rich real-world insights, and potentially one day add to the way care is delivered. Today, we begin. For more information, visit www.projectbaseline.com.",
